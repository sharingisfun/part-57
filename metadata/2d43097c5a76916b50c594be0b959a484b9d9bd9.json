Local entrepreneur Ben Squire is struggling to make ends meet during a busy summer season, but with a fishing operation, boat trips and a cafe to juggle, it isn't proving easy. The new ship's company of HMS Sutherland also face a testing time as they try to prove they are up to the job so the vessel can rejoin active service in the Royal Navy.\r\n\r\n2)  Tyneside \r\nA visit to the Shields Ferry during the Great North Run, which provides staff with the busiest day of the year, and a look at economic challenges facing Tyneside's largest manufacturing yard OGN. Plus, life within South Shields Marine School, where Chris Falconer and Ryan Bird are training to be deck officers.\r\n\r\n3)  Portsmouth \r\nIn this Episode we travel to Portsmouth on the south coast, one of three homes to the Royal Navy in the UK. On Her Majesty's Naval Base, three candidates battle for places at the Royal Marines School of Music, while HMS Severn returns home after a seven-month mission patrolling Caribbean waters. Meanwhile, fruit quality inspector Mathew Read talks about his 20-year career ensuring the vast supply of Britain's bananas is ship-shape, and maintaining the rigging of a historic ship requires a good head for heights.\r\n\r\n4)  The Humber Estuary \r\nThe Humber estuary boasts three major ports - Hull, Goole and Immingham - united by a stretch of river that is treacherous but economically essential for Britain's east coast and beyond. As this film reveals, ships' pilots rely heavily on the work of the back-up staff that chart and mark the shipping lanes in the shifting river bed as well as those teams that clear the moving silt. In addition to those workers, this documentary also follows best friends Dave Taft and Gavin Feldt as they ready their powerboats for a Grand Prix of the Sea event.\r\n\r\n5)  Liverpool \r\nA cruise terminal manager is at the centre of a historic anniversary visit by Cunard Line's cruise ships, and a charity swim across the Mersey becomes a major challenge.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a3/Sea-Cities-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4a/Sea-Cities-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ee/Sea-Cities-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e6/Sea-Cities-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f9/Sea-Cities-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/40/Sea-Cities-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bd/Sea-Cities-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b7/Sea-Cities-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c2/Sea-Cities-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a0/Sea-Cities-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b2/Sea-Cities-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/91/Sea-Cities-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b5/Sea-Cities-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a9/Sea-Cities-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d7/Sea-Cities-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a0/Sea-Cities-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3013 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 5\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.30 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/programme/dy8ngc/sea-cities/episodeguide/series-1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d43097c5a76916b50c594be0b959a484b9d9bd9","amp;dn":"BBC+Sea+Cities+Series+1+5of5+Liverpool+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGrou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d43097c5a76916b50c594be0b959a484b9d9bd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,67,9,124,90,118,145,107,80,197,148,190,11,149,154,72,75,157,155,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
