Laing quickly settles into high society life and meets the buildingâ€™s eccentric tenants: Charlotte (Miller), his upstairs neighbor and bohemian single mother; Wilder (Evans), a charismatic documentarian who lives with his pregnant wife Helen (Moss); and Mr. Royal (Irons), the enigmatic architect who designed the building. Life seems like paradise to the solitude-seeking Laing. But as power outages become more frequent and building flaws emerge, particularly on the lower floors, the regimented social strata begins to crumble and the building becomes a battlefield in a literal class war.\r\n\r\nDirector: Ben Wheatley\r\n\r\nWriters: Amy Jump\r\n\r\nActors: Tom Hiddleston, Jeremy Irons, Sienna Miller, Luke Evans, Elisabeth Moss, James Purefoy\r\n\r\nGenre: Drama\r\n\r\nRun Time: 1 hour 59 minutes\r\n\r\nStudio: Â© 2016 Magnolia Pictures","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:237ff9804f4b8b41c78920f0ee71f29bdde9cd60","amp;dn":"High-Rise.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%231+%5BHD%5D+%282016%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"237ff9804f4b8b41c78920f0ee71f29bdde9cd60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,127,249,128,79,75,139,65,199,137,32,240,238,113,242,155,221,233,205,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
