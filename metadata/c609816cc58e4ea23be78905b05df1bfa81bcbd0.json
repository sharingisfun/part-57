Constantly sitting \r\nand standing and tons of people \r\nmaking beer runs and bathroom breaks.  \r\nIt's just one of those things I can't \r\ncontrol.  Video turned out quite well \r\nalthough not as good as my Columbus \r\nWho video.  I wanted to get this up \r\nbefore I leave on vacation tomorrow \r\nas I will be gone for almost 3 weeks.  \r\nI obviously didn't watch this show \r\na second time yet so I don't believe \r\nany problems except what I mentioned \r\nallready.  As always with any of my videos.  \r\nPlease do what you want with them, \r\nshare them, edit them, dub them or whatever.  \r\nEnjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c609816cc58e4ea23be78905b05df1bfa81bcbd0","amp;dn":"The+Who+2016-02-27+Joe+Louis+Arena%2C+Detroit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c609816cc58e4ea23be78905b05df1bfa81bcbd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,9,129,108,197,142,78,162,59,231,137,5,176,93,241,191,168,27,203,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
