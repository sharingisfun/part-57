It was adapted from the play of the same name by Leonard Spigelgass, which was a Broadway hit in the 1959-60 season, starring Gertrude Berg and Cedric Hardwicke.\r\n\r\nBertha Jacoby (Rosalind Russell), a Jewish widow, is convinced by her daughter Alice Black (Madlyn Rhue) to move from Brooklyn, New York, to Tokyo in order for Bertha to be closer to her along with her husband, Jerry Black (Ray Danton), now stationed at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. Her feelings about the Japanese with regards to her son's death in World War II start to change on board the ship to Tokyo, where she meets Koichi Asano, a Japanese Buddhist businessman, Koichi Asano (Alec Guinness), who also lost a spouse and two children in the War. The two share a bond over lives, their families, and their faiths, which develops into a romance. When she announces Asano's courtship to her family, her daughter and son-in-law object to the idea of an interracial marriage.\r\n\r\nâ€” Wikipedia: A Majority of One\r\n\r\nStar Trek star George Takei appears as the son of Asano, although he was not credited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Specifications\r\n\r\nFormat : MPEG-4\r\nFormat profile : Base Media / Version 2\r\nCodec ID : mp42 (isom/iso2/avc1/mp41)\r\nFile size : 1.50 GiB\r\nDuration : 2h 29mn\r\nOverall bit rate mode : Variable\r\nOverall bit rate : 1 439 Kbps\r\n\r\nVideo\r\n\r\nID : 1\r\nFormat : AVC\r\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\r\nFormat profile :   \r\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\r\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames\r\nCodec ID : avc1\r\nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding\r\nDuration : 2h 29mn\r\nBit rate : 1 271 Kbps\r\nWidth : 720 pixels\r\nHeight : 480 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nOriginal display aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode : Variable\r\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\r\nMinimum frame rate : 15.152 fps\r\nMaximum frame rate : 30.303 fps\r\n\r\nAudio\r\n\r\nID : 2\r\nFormat : AAC\r\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\r\nFormat profile : LC\r\nCodec ID : 40\r\nDuration : 2h 29mn\r\nBit rate mode : Variable\r\nBit rate : 160 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nFrame rate : 46.875 fps (1024 spf)\r\nCompression mode : Lossy\r\nStream size : 171 MiB (11%)\r\nTitle : Stereo / Stereo\r\nLanguage : English\r\nDefault : Yes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e83258f0bd06102c2c3105aab231a08086acb0b0","amp;dn":"A+Majority+of+One+%281961%29+DVDRIP+x264.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e83258f0bd06102c2c3105aab231a08086acb0b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,50,88,240,189,6,16,44,44,49,5,170,178,49,160,128,134,172,176,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
