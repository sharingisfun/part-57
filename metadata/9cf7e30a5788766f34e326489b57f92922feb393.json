These CPUs, in example, don't support SSE4.1: Core 2 Duo (E6XXX), Kentsfield Core 2 Quad (Q6XXX), all AMD Phenom CPUs, all AMD Athlon 64X CPUs.\r\n\r\n Ques: The game loading forever after the prologue/crash/freeze at cutscene after ambulance cutscene\r\n Ans: Copy the whole 3DMGAME from &quot;Save File for Skipping Prologue&quot; folder to game root folder, overwriting all files and run the game, now you're past prologue.Make sure not to change anything in '3DMGAME.ini' file ...\r\n\r\n After applying 'save file for skipping prologue' , it changes interface language to russian , change it to english by this:\r\n In the menu choose 3rd line, (options)\r\n then choose 4th line (display settings)\r\n then change from PyccKnn to AHRnncknn (second from leftmost)\r\n ask you if you are sure, choose DA\r\n\r\n Ques: Why the description says v1.0.0.5 while the games says v1.0.0.1.\r\n Ans: It's tricky. Data files in this version are from v1.0.0.5, but the executable - from v1.0.0.1, cause 3DM never cracked the latter versions. But it's fully playable till the end. Just follow the instructions to overcome bugs.\r\n\r\n Ques: I can't play Mission 46, it's loading forever\r\n Ans: Exit the game after you unlock M46, then run (as admin!) &quot;Fix Mission 46.bat&quot; in game root and wait until it's finished. Run the game again and complete the mission. It will say &quot;Game Over&quot;. Quit the game again and run &quot;UnFix Mission 46.bat&quot; to restore original &quot;data1.dat&quot; file. Then you can continue the game as before.\r\n\r\n Ques: I can't play Missions 29 &amp; 42\r\n Ans: Just don't use Quiet for these two missions. It's original game bug, which was fixed in newer patches, but the crack... read above.\r\n\r\n Ques: The game doesn't have audio\r\n Ans: Restart the game.\r\n\r\n**INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:\r\n\r\nOpen 'Metal Gear Solid V The Phantom Pain repack Mr DJ.part1.exe' , wait for around 1 or 2 minutes for self extractor to open, specify the directory where u want to extract the setup folder, open the extracted folder.....\r\nOR\r\nExtract it yourself by opening any other part using 'WinRAR', open the extracted folder....\r\n\r\nDISABLE YOUR ANTIVIRUS BEFORE RUNNING 'Setup.exe' (IMPORTANT) to avoid any error message . 3DMGAME.dll missing error is caused due to AV blocking the crack (For avast users: Just Disable DeepScreen in antivirus settings)...\r\n\r\nAfter running setup,, click on 'Configure',, specify the install directory,, click on next and next,, select the necessary software (Direct X and visual c++ [provided in Redist folder]),, again next,, finally on 'Install'...PLAY THE GAME FROM DESKTOP SHORTCUT using run as administrator.... \r\n\r\nAlways open the game using 'Run as administrator' to avoid any savegame/crash issue, if it still crashes, lower the graphics settings and make sure u meet the system requirements along with updated graphic drivers for your graphics card ...\r\n\r\nCheck out my Official FB page:\r\nMr DJ repacks\r\nLike it guys to support, to get any help and updates on upcoming repacks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cf7e30a5788766f34e326489b57f92922feb393","amp;dn":"Metal+Gear+Solid+V+Phantom+Pain+v1.0.0.5+Multi+8+repack+Mr+DJ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cf7e30a5788766f34e326489b57f92922feb393","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,247,227,10,87,136,118,111,52,227,38,72,155,87,249,41,34,254,179,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
