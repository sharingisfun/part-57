These complexes have found diverse applications in materials chemistry, nanoscience, catalysis, food sciences, and medicine, and this has led to a rapid expansion in supramolecular chemistry research. With contributions from high profile international scientists working within the field, each book in the Series covers a key concept for graduate level students and above interested in supramolecular chemistry and its diverse applications. The books are ideal for reference and as state-of-the art guides, and they aim to enable further developments of new applications through an understanding of the fundamentals and a comprehensive overview of the latest research.\r\n\r\nSeries DOI: 10.1039/2041-7144\r\nPrint ISSN: 1368-8642\r\nSeries ISSN: 1368-8642\r\n\r\nSeries editor(s)\r\n\r\nPhilip Gale\r\nUniversity of Southampton, UK\r\nSeries Editor\r\n\r\nJonathan Steed\r\nDurham University, UK\r\nSeries Editor","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c2899e6803240fc8b17e9281ed6e9cc5e4f85f5","amp;dn":"Monographs+in+Supramolecular+Chemistry+%5BUpdated+at+2016.02.21%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c2899e6803240fc8b17e9281ed6e9cc5e4f85f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,40,153,230,128,50,64,252,139,23,233,40,30,214,233,204,94,79,133,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
