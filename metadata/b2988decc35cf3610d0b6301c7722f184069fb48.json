In this sci-fi comedy, some exciting new alien species are introduced as the crew of the Camden Lock find themselves in various (and sometimes life-threatening) predicaments, which are mostly brought on by themselves. Commander Henderson, Nick Frost, tries his best, but with officers like York and Teal this is not easy. Also, do not pretend not to marvel at the Queppu. They can see you marvel.\r\n\r\nStars: Nick Frost, Kevin Eldon, Miranda Hart","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2988decc35cf3610d0b6301c7722f184069fb48","amp;dn":"Hyperdrive+%5BComplete+DVD-MKV%5D+plus+DVD+Extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2988decc35cf3610d0b6301c7722f184069fb48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,152,141,236,195,92,243,97,13,11,99,1,199,114,47,24,64,105,251,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
