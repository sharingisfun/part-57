Witherington highlights the core Christian claims by investigating figures such as Mary the mother of Jesus; Mary Magdalene; Thomes, Peter, James, Paul and others. In each chapter he addresses the full range of questions about these figures and what each of them can teach us about the historical Jesus. This is a necessary corrective to the wild theorists who build castles upon fragments such as The Gospel of Judas. The main New Testament figures are our best sources by far.\r\n\r\n Please seed.
