We find also what really had happened to the mutilated 13 y.o. boy Isaac who was accused by state security officers that he abused a bust of Stalin and was thrown into the cellar to die. The little magician-molfar does not vanish, his life is going on, he has many other adventures and pranks ahead and the novel reaches so much powerful, emotional and bright culmination which would have been envied even by Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nThe theme of maternal love and the need of each person in his mother's love makes the book eternal and in our days.\r\n\r\nExtended edition.
