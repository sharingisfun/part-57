Impressed by the hunchback's vast knowledge of human\r\nanatomy, acquired from stolen books, Victor rescues him, drains the cyst on his back that\r\ncauses his physical abnormality and develops a harness to improve his posture, and then\r\nnames him &quot;Igor&quot; after a recently deceased roommate. The two then become partners in\r\nVictor's ongoing experiments to create life through artificial means, incurring the wrath\r\nof religious police inspector Roderick Turpin (Andrew Scott), who views their experiments\r\nas sinful.\r\n\r\nBox Office\r\n\r\nBudget: N/A\r\nOpening Weekend: $2,350,000 (USA) (27 November 2015)\r\nGross: $5,773,519 (USA) (25 December 2015)\r\nWorldwide: $34,140,474 (Worldwide) (18 February 2016)\r\nFilming Dates: 25 November 2013 - 20 March 2014\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that all screenshot was captured at 1080p, resized to 720p\r\nand then compressed using PNG to improve the loading time.\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/15965454023334021167.png  \r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/39991943769511184561.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/35165150824211000619.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/90072136230376855083.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/34278105726220647957.png  \r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/40244660458972767511.png\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1976009/\r\n\r\n:: General ::\r\n\r\nFormat: Matroska/MKV\r\nFile Size: 10.3 GiB\r\nOverall Bit Rate: 13.5 Mbps\r\nFormat profile:   \r\nDuration: 01:49:49\r\nSample: Yes\r\nSubtitles: English / Polski\r\nChapters: Yes\r\nEncoded By oneanight\r\n\r\n:: Video Info ::\r\n\r\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\r\nWriting library: x264\r\nVideo bitrate: 11.5 Mbps\r\nResolution: 1920 X 800 pixels\r\nAspect ratio(AR): 2.40:1\r\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\r\n\r\n:: Audio Info ::\r\n\r\nFormat profile: DTS / AC3\r\nAudio Bit rate 1: 1509 Kbps\r\nAudio Bit rate 2: 448 Kbps Kbps\r\nCompression mode: Lossy/Lossy\r\nBit rate mode Constant/Constant\r\nAudio Language: English / Polski\r\nSampling rate: 48.0 KHz Bit depth 24 bits/48.0 KHz\r\nChannel positions: Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\r\nChannels:1 &amp; 2 7 channels 6 channels 5.1 Surround\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dea47962427e224ccf372ca156d163d595a3c035","amp;dn":"Victor+Frankenstein+-+%5B2015%5D+1080p+BDRip+x264+DTS+AC3+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dea47962427e224ccf372ca156d163d595a3c035","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,164,121,98,66,126,34,76,207,55,44,161,86,209,99,213,149,163,192,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
