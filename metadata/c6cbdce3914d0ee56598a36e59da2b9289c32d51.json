We wrap up our look back at the first year with an overall review of the entire season. \r\n\r\nBY CHRIS CARABOTT For those of you who watched Lost: Season 1 when it originally aired, I can safely tell you, it is as good as you remember it being. For those that still haven't jumped on board the Lost bandwagon â€“ what the hell are you waiting for? Lost Season 1 sets the stage for what is considered by many to be one of the best sci-fi mysteries currently on television and it does a fantastic job of introducing the vast array of characters that inhabit this exciting world. The entire first season is handled like one long introduction, barely scratching the surface of what the universe has to offer. There is plenty of care taken in developing each of the characters and by the conclusion of the season you'll find yourself enthralled in an engaging sci-fi mystery. \r\n\r\nLost Season 1 succeeds first and foremost in character development â€“ I can't stress this enough. Throughout my reviews over the course of this season I've used the term 'character study' a few times to describe various episodes. Lost is about relationships and before we can understand the dynamic behind the various relationships that develop over the course of a season, we need to understand what motivates these characters. This shows approach of having an individual episode focus on a single character through flashback, while formulaic, is a brilliant decision. It kind of reminds me of the layers of a cake, and the backstory to each of these survivors is the foundation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6cbdce3914d0ee56598a36e59da2b9289c32d51","amp;dn":"Lost+-+Seasons+1+and+2+-+Repaired","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6cbdce3914d0ee56598a36e59da2b9289c32d51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,203,220,227,145,77,14,229,101,152,163,110,89,218,43,146,137,195,45,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
