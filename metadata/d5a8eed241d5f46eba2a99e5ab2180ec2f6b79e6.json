Here's where it gets tricky, because this isn't the first time Gary's been late for work, and he could be fired if he's spotted arriving at his desk after everyone else yet again. So heâ€™ll have to prove his smartness and slyness to make his way up the 22 floors standing between him and his office without being caught.\r\nFrom the basement to the bossâ€™s office via the research and development labs, explore the zany little universe of LEVEL 22.\r\nHide in closets, crawl through air vents, slink along the wallsâ€¦ nobody must spot you!\r\nUse everything in your reach to get to the end of the level: hide behind a newspaper, smash a vending machine with a well-aimed kick, or use donuts to lure the security guards away.\r\nWant to drive your colleagues crazy, knock them out, poison them or even expose them to harmful radiation?\r\nFool photocopiers, stroll hiding in a cardboard box or distribute laxatives ... It is possible in Level 22!\r\nReady to settle the score with your bosses?\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: 7 / 8 / 10\r\nProcessor: 2.0 GHz \r\nMemory: 1 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: 128mb\r\nDirectX: Version 9.0c \r\nStorage: 300 MB available space","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5a8eed241d5f46eba2a99e5ab2180ec2f6b79e6","amp;dn":"Level22+Gary%27s+Misadventures+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5a8eed241d5f46eba2a99e5ab2180ec2f6b79e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,168,238,210,65,213,244,110,186,42,153,229,171,33,128,236,47,107,121,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
