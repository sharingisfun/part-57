Christopher Farnsworth thrives on order and decorum. A simple dinner party and a bowl of potato soup are ruined when Lily's penchant for suffragette rallies and Christopher's military ideas of prim and proper meet and clash.\r\n\r\nThe two soon find themselves agreeing to a wager and love is the intended outcome. The premise? A suitable match by Easter. If he loses, he'll attend Easter church services dressed in one of his aunt's outrageously colored and beaded gowns. If she loses, she'll ride, Lady Godiva-style, around the heart of Indianapolis.\r\n\r\nThe problem is neither Christopher nor Lily can find matches that measure up to themselves. Romantic sabotage is the order of the day. The original wager is forgotten and the only thing the pair gamble with is their hearts.\r\n\r\nGenre: Romance Historical","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14acd0037fcb3862c1ba822b571484cfb3c47327","amp;dn":"Winner+Takes+All+by+Sandra+Sookoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14acd0037fcb3862c1ba822b571484cfb3c47327","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,172,208,3,127,203,56,98,193,186,130,43,87,20,132,207,179,196,115,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
