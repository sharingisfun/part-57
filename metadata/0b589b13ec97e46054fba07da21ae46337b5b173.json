Alone in the hands of ruthless killers, she will need every ounce of courage she possesses to survive.\r\n\r\nBetrayed by another operative, Deputy U.S. Marshal Zach McBride has endured a week of torture and interrogation at the hands of a bloodthirsty Mexican drug cartel. Ready to give his life if he must, he remains unbrokenuntil he hears the cries of an American woman.\r\n\r\nAlthough Natalie is only a voice in the darkness of their shared prison, her plight brings renewed strength to Zach's battered body. With her help, he overpowers their captors, and they flee through the desert toward the border, the attraction between them flaring hotter than the Sonoran sun.\r\n\r\nBut past loss and tragedy leave both of them reluctant to follow their hearts, even when the passion between them reaches its breaking point. Faced with feelings neither expected, they fight to stay ahead of the danger that hunts them as forces more powerful than they can imagine conspire to destroy them both","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b589b13ec97e46054fba07da21ae46337b5b173","amp;dn":"Pamela+Clare-Breaking+Point","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b589b13ec97e46054fba07da21ae46337b5b173","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,88,155,19,236,151,228,96,84,251,160,125,162,26,228,99,55,181,177,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
