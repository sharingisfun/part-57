A journey of astonishing confidence and courage.â€â€”Rory Stewart\r\n\r\nOne of the largest rivers in the world, the Indus rises in the Tibetan mountains and flows west across northern India and south through Pakistan. It has been worshipped as a god, used as a tool of imperial expansion, and today is the cement of Pakistanâ€™s fractious union. Alice Albinia follows the river upstream, through two thousand miles of geography and back to a time five thousand years ago when a string of sophisticated cities grew on its banks. â€œThis turbulent history, entwined with a superlative travel narrativeâ€ (The Guardian) leads us from the ruins of elaborate metropolises, to the bitter divisions of today. Like Rory Stewartâ€™s The Places In Between, Empires of the Indus is an engrossing personal journey and a deeply moving portrait of a river and its people. \r\n18 illustrations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f6466c8243aabde93adebf92f49c46a84b46a29","amp;dn":"Empires+of+the+Indus%3A+The+Story+of+a+River+-+Alice+Albinia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f6466c8243aabde93adebf92f49c46a84b46a29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,100,102,200,36,58,171,222,147,173,235,249,47,73,196,106,132,180,106,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
