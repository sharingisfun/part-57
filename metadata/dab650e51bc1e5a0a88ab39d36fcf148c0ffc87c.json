Using 2009â€™s All I Ever Wanted as a rough template, Clarkson is nevertheless willing to dip back to the beginning of her career for skyscraping, crowd-pleasing power ballads, but sheâ€™s assuredly not retreating. Kelly lives in the modern world, and quite cannily so, at times co-opting Rihanna and Katy Perry while also making room for a duet with country hunk Jason Aldean, all the while never seeming as if sheâ€™s desperately chasing different demographics. Nevertheless, Stronger certainly has something for anybody who has ever loved Kelly: she belts out the show-stopper â€œStanding in Front of You,â€ then turns around for a blast of furious pop-punk in â€œI Forgive Youâ€; she even dips her toe into brooding My December territory on â€œThe War Is Over,â€ then pushes into the brilliantly dense pop of â€œLet Me Downâ€; and she cheerfully gets tough on the girl power anthems â€œEinsteinâ€ and â€œDonâ€™t Be a Girl About Itâ€ (the latter only on the deluxe edition). Certainly, part of the variety is down to the multitude of producers and writers on Stronger, but the albumâ€™s success is entirely due to Kelly Clarkson, whose personality and professionalism turn it into her best album since her Breakaway breakthrough in 2004.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01.
