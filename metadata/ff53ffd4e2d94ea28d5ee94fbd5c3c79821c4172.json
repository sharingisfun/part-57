I wanted my life to be normal, which it could not be.â€™\r\n\r\nFor the first time Yuvraj Singh tells the real story behind the 2011 World Cup when on-the-field triumph hid his increasingly puzzling health problems and worrying illnesses. In his debut book The test of my life, he reveals howâ€”plagued with insomnia, coughing fits that left him vomiting blood, and an inability to eatâ€”he made a deal with God. On the night before the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup final, Yuvraj prayed for the World Cup in return for anything God wanted. In this book, he lays bare his fears, doubts, and the lows he experienced during chemotherapyâ€” when he lost his energy, his appetite, and his hairâ€”and his battle to find the will to survive. Poignant, personal, and movingâ€”The test of my lifeâ€”is about cancer and cricket; but more importantly, it is about the human will to fight adversity and triumph despite all odds","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff53ffd4e2d94ea28d5ee94fbd5c3c79821c4172","amp;dn":"The+Test+of+My+Life%3A+From+Cricket+to+Cancer+and+Back+%5BAM63%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff53ffd4e2d94ea28d5ee94fbd5c3c79821c4172","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,83,255,212,226,217,78,162,141,94,233,79,189,92,60,121,130,28,65,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
