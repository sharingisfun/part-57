One night, the Turkish police rounds up all the Armenian men in the city, including the young blacksmith, Nazaret Manoogian, who is separated from his family. Years later, after managing to survive the horrors of the genocide, he learns his two daughters are also still alive. Determined to find them, his search takes him from the Mesopotamian deserts and Havana to the barren and desolate prairies of North Dakota. On his journey, he encounters a range of very different people from the angelic and kind hearted to the devil incarnate.\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguages: English / Armenian / Turkish / Kurdish / Arabic / Spanish\r\n\r\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9855011193c15fda8cbb92923338935ffdaf4212","amp;dn":"The+Cut+2014+BRRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9855011193c15fda8cbb92923338935ffdaf4212","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,85,1,17,147,193,95,218,140,187,146,146,51,56,147,95,253,175,66,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
