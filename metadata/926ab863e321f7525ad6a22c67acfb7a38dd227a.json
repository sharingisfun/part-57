Yennefer had previously tried to get in contact with Geralt, but had been forced to flee in order to avoid the fighting between the warring powers of Nilfgaard and Redania.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is Yennefer who ultimately finds Geralt. Accompanied by a Nilfgaardian honor guard, Yennefer informs Geralt that Emhyr var Emreis, the emperor of Nilfgaard, has summoned Geralt for an imperial audience in Vizima, the nation's capital. In Vizima, Emhyr tasks Geralt with finding Ciri, the emperor's biological daughter and Geralt's adoptive ward. Ciri is a Child of the Elder Blood, the last heir to an ancient Elven bloodline that bestows her with the power to manipulate space and time. Emhyr believes that she is on the run from the Wild Hunt, a retinue of spectral elves determined to capture Ciri and use her abilities for their own malicious purposes. Geralt agrees to search for her, but for her benefit, not Emhyr's. Yennefer instructs him to begin his search by getting in contact with a Nilfgaardian spy in Velen.\r\n \r\nKeep Download And Seeding \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Seed please","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:926ab863e321f7525ad6a22c67acfb7a38dd227a","amp;dn":"Witcher+3+The+Wild+Hunt+Superpack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"926ab863e321f7525ad6a22c67acfb7a38dd227a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,106,184,99,227,33,247,82,90,214,162,44,103,172,251,122,56,221,34,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
