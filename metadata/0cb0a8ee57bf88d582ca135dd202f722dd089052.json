In the 1980s, the Minneapolis music scene was primarily known for The Replacements, Soul Asylum, HÃ¼sker DÃ¼ and Prince among others. In the Twin Cities, Slave Raider had a sizeable following that were known as &quot;The Raid&quot;. They opened for such 1980s bands as Ratt and Poison with the original lineup.\r\n\r\nThe band recorded three albums in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but were never able to make much of a dent in the glam metal scene of the time due to the beginning of the grunge movement that has been attributed to the influence of their fellow Minnesotans, The Replacements.\r\n\r\nThe band was dropped by its record label following their third album release in 1990 and broke up soon after that with the band members going on to solo projects. The original line up has periodically reunited since then to perform the occasional reunion show that is always &quot;standing room only&quot;.\r\n\r\nThe song &quot;Youngblood&quot;, written by Slave Raider members and performed by Slave Raider, appeared in the 1994 movie entitled The Paper, which was nominated for an Oscar.\r\n\r\nSlave Raider's &quot;Make Some Noise&quot; (written by Slave Raider and D. Nagel) appeared in 1988's License to Drive.\r\n\r\nTake the World by Storm is their debut studio album , released independently in 1986. In December 1987, the album was remixed and released to the public in 1988 through the Jive record label, suffering poor sales. The band did have a cult following in Minneapolis. The remixed Make Some Noise was released as a single and a promotional video was shot in The Twin Cities. In the remix, Make Some Noise was cut by around a minute and The Black Hole has a longer introduction. It was available scarcely on CD, cassette, and vinyl and was out of print until Divebomb Records reissued it and the band's sophomore release What Do You Know About Rock 'N Roll? in April 2015.\r\nTrack listing\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. \tTitle \tMusic \tLength\r\n1. \t&quot;Take the World by Storm&quot;   \tChainsaw Caine, Nicci Wikkid \t2:54\r\n2. \t&quot;Backstabbin&quot;   \tCaine, Lance Sabin \t2:44\r\n3. \t&quot;Make Some Noise&quot;   \tCaine, Nagel, Wikkid \t4:38\r\n4. \t&quot;Burnin' Too Hot&quot;   \tCaine, Wikkid, Sabin \t3:21\r\n5. \t&quot;Long Way from Home&quot;   \tCaine, Wikkid \t2:48\r\n6. \t&quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot;   \tCaine, Wikkid, Letitia Rae, Sabin \t6:28\r\n7. \t&quot;The Devil Comes Out in Me&quot;   \tCaine, Sabin \t2:56\r\n8. \t&quot;The Black Hole&quot;   \tCaine, Sabin, Hodnick, Wikkid \t7:42\r\n\r\nPlayers\r\n\r\nLead vocals - Chainsaw Caine (Mike Findling)\r\nBass guitar/backing vocals - Letitia Rae\r\nAcoustic and electronic percussion - The Rock (Richard Jacquin)\r\nLead and rhythm guitar - Lance Sabin\r\nLead and rhythm guitar/backing vocals - Nicci Wikkid (David Hussman)\r\nKeyboards - Lee Blaske","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cb0a8ee57bf88d582ca135dd202f722dd089052","amp;dn":"Slave+Raider+-+Take+The+World+By+Storm+1987+320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cb0a8ee57bf88d582ca135dd202f722dd089052","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,176,168,238,87,191,136,213,130,202,19,93,210,2,247,34,221,8,144,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
