Each issue is printed in full color on heavy matte stock to create durability so that readers can enjoy each issue over and over again. In keeping with our commitment to simplicity and content-focus, Daughters of Promise is ad-free and reader-supported. We are staffed 100% by volunteers and all content is received on a volunteer basis. Visually, DOP bears a unique place in the Christian magazine industry, offering aesthetically appealing design that is both simple and beautiful.\r\n\r\nDaughters of Promise magazine fills a very specific niche in that it is produced by women of the Anabaptist denomination and offers content which is cohesive with the belief and practices of this conservative Christianity community. The message of Daughters of Promise, however, is not bound by earthly denominations; it is the message of the Gospel and an invitation for women of all walks of life to enter into deep communion with Jesus. Our passion is to see women flourishing in the abundant life He came to give. \r\n\r\n\r\nDaughters of Promise 2013\r\nDaughters of Promise 2013-01, 02.pdf \t7.05 MB \t\r\nDaughters of Promise 2013-03, 04.pdf \t9.18 MB \t\r\nDaughters of Promise 2013-05, 06.pdf \t17.42 MB \t\r\nDaughters of Promise 2013-07, 08.pdf \t9.99 MB \t\r\nDaughters of Promise 2013-09, 10.pdf \t15.3 MB \t\r\nDaughters of Promise 2013-11, 12.pdf \t12.66 MB \t\r\n\r\nDaughters of Promise 2014\r\nDaughters of Promise 2014-01, 02.pdf \t14.25 MB \t\r\nDaughters of Promise 2014-03, 04.pdf \t14.07 MB \t\r\nDaughters of Promise 2014-05, 06.pdf \t17.64 MB \t\r\nDaughters of Promise 2014-07, 08.pdf \t13.78 MB \t\r\nDaughters of Promise 2014-09, 10.pdf \t4.6 MB \t\r\nDaughters of Promise 2014-11, 12.pdf \t10.89 MB \t\r\n\r\nDaughters of Promise 2015\r\nDaughters of Promise 2015-01, 02.pdf \t3.95 MB \t\r\nDaughters of Promise 2015-03, 04.pdf \t3.17 MB \t\r\nDaughters of Promise 2015-05, 06.pdf \t22.38 MB \t\r\nDaughters of Promise 2015-07, 08.pdf \t9.25 MB \t\r\nDaughters of Promise 2015-09, 10.pdf \t9.63 MB \t\r\nDaughters of Promise 2015-11, 12.pdf \t10.28 MB \t\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEASE DO NOT HIT AND RUN !\r\n\r\nSEED AS MUCH AS YOU CAN !\r\n\r\nDaughters of Promise 2016\r\nDaughters of Promise 2016-01, 02.pdf \t11.82 MB \t\r\nDaughters of Promise 2016-03, 04.pdf \t12.5 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8660cf973c27c9e3161c3d17d1b6fe0b9cf369e","amp;dn":"Daughters+of+Promise+Magazine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8660cf973c27c9e3161c3d17d1b6fe0b9cf369e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,102,12,249,115,194,124,158,49,97,195,209,125,27,111,224,185,207,54,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
