There's a bratty, yet not offputting, tone to the singing in particular and the songs in general, which seem like a piecemeal diary of a relationship (or relationships) breaking up and coming together again. There's also something of a generic tone to the arrangements, which reflect less effort for variety and intelligence than have been poured into the lyrics. It's young love and identity on the verge of maturing through sometimes bitter experience, though not related as compellingly as it has in other annals of popular song, punk or otherwise","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c13e5682228df9a863e129991f3d69b70c15252","amp;dn":"The+Movielife+-+Forty+Hour+Train+Back+To+Penn+%282003%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c13e5682228df9a863e129991f3d69b70c15252","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,19,229,104,34,40,223,154,134,62,18,153,145,243,214,155,112,193,82,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
