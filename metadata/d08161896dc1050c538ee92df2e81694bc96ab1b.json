This book explores for the first time the genesis and early development of this important genre as it took place in Italy in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Joanna Woods-Marsden examines a series of self-portraits in Renaissance Italy and their relation to the social status of art and artists. She argues that these self-images represented the aspirations of their creators to change the status of art and thereby their own social standing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d08161896dc1050c538ee92df2e81694bc96ab1b","amp;dn":"Renaissance+Self-Portraiture+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d08161896dc1050c538ee92df2e81694bc96ab1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,129,97,137,109,193,5,12,83,142,233,45,242,232,22,148,188,150,171,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
