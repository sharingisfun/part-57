Understanding that the brain is the utmost private part of ourselves is vital. However, it is being exploited by science and technology to create something unimaginable, an artificial brain. Creating a computer that has the capabilities of the human mind would require combining the power of 120 billion personal computers. At this moment, in this world, there arenâ€™t enough computers or processors to even equal the amount of power the human mind is capable of or at least not yet. Over the course of the next five years, scientists, researchers, and engineers who are ranked top in their respective fields will attempt the impossible. Reverse engineering the brain in order to create an artificial one.\r\n\r\nThe power that will dwell inside such computer, compared to a human brain, could revolutionize technology as we know it. However, there is a much darker side to it all. According to Elon Musk, South African-born Canadian-American business magnate, engineer, inventor and investor; it is literally â€œsummoning the demon.â€ The radical ideology behind such computing would change the face of privacy concerns. Governmental overreach in this day and age would look like freedom to future generations. According to Bill Gates, the internet would be the memories, and the informational experience, that would make up the artificial brains algorithms.\r\n\r\nCoding such a script would end mankind. The purpose of such a machine is not for the benefit of mankind, but for the perseverance of the elite. In all reality who would control the machine, where would the â€œoff-switchâ€ be? Who would it serve? It would serve itself and those who programmed it.\r\n\r\nArtificial intelligence is not a new idea it started in the 1980â€™s. However, the applications of artificial intelligence started just a few years ago. Smart phones, self-driving cars, atmospheric control, and modern computers are all a form of artificial intelligence. It starts with convenience, and then it takes control.\r\n\r\nThere is Not Much Time Left; the BRAIN of Destruction is Tak.mp4 - 00:59:44 1280 x 720\r\n\r\nScreens: \nhttp://i.imgur.com/XPbxslO.png \nhttp://i.imgur.com/MzfXMw3.png \nhttp://i.imgur.com/SafNpdS.png","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a5afd66044f3be5b681fb9414884f48855be8ff","amp;dn":"Freedom+Fighter+Times+-+There+is+Not+Much+Time+Left%3B+the+BRAIN+o","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a5afd66044f3be5b681fb9414884f48855be8ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,90,253,102,4,79,59,229,182,129,251,148,20,136,79,72,133,91,232,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
