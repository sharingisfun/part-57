Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the crew of the Starfleet starship Enterprise-D.\r\n\r\nThe season begins with the crew defeating Lore and his group of rogue Borg, resulting in the disassembly of Lore. It continued this theme of family history with most of the episodes. After dealing with Lore, Data also confronts the realization that his â€œmotherâ€ is still alive (&quot;Inheritance&quot;). In &quot;Interface&quot;, Geordi attempts to save his mother from a damaged ship and is forced to deal with his loss. Worf meets a future version of his son, Alexander, in &quot;Firstborn&quot; and his foster brother in &quot;Homeward&quot;.\r\n\r\nBoth Troi and Dr. Crusher confront old family secrets in &quot;Dark Page&quot; and &quot;Sub Rosa&quot;. Picard also faces challenges with a son he never knew he had in &quot;Bloodlines&quot; and his relationship with his family â€“ past, present, and future â€“ in the series finale &quot;All Good Things...&quot;\r\n\r\nThe series ends with Q concluding his trial of humanity, giving Picard an opportunity to save all of mankind.\r\n\r\n    \t\r\n    \r\nEpisodes Edit\r\nTitle\r\n\tEpisode\r\n\tProdno.\r\n\tStardate\r\n\tOriginal Airdate\r\nDescent, Part II7x01 \t40277-253 \t47025.4 \t1993-09-18\r\nLiaisons \t7x02 \t40277-254 \tUnknown \t1993-09-25\r\nInterface \t7x03 \t40277-255 \t47215.5 \t1993-10-04\r\nGambit, Part I \t7x04 \t40277-256 \t47135.2 \t1993-10-09\r\nGambit, Part II 7x05 \t40277-257 \t47160.1 \t1993-10-16\r\nPhantasms \t7x06 \t40277-258 \t47225.7 \t1993-10-23\r\nDark Page \t7x07 \t40277-259 \t47254.1 \t1993-10-30\r\nAttached \t7x08 \t40277-260 \t47304.2 \t1993-11-06\r\nForce of Nature\t7x09 \t40277-261 \t47310.2 \t1993-11-15\r\nInheritance \t7x10 \t40277-262 \t47410.2 \t1993-11-22\r\nParallels \t7x11 \t40277-263 \t47391.2 \t1993-11-27\r\nThe Pegasus \t7x12 \t40277-264 \t47457.1 \t1994-01-10\r\nHomeward \t7x13 \t40277-265 \t47423.9 \t1994-01-15\r\nSub Rosa \t7x14 \t40277-266 \tUnknown \t1994-01-31\r\nLower Decks \t7x15 \t40277-267 \t47566.7 \t1994-02-07\r\nThine Own Self \t7x16 \t40277-268 \t47611.2 \t1994-02-14\r\nMasks \t        7x17 \t40277-269 \t47615.2 \t1994-02-19\r\nEye of the Beholder 7x1840277-270 \t47622.1 \t1994-02-26\r\nGenesis \t7x19 \t40277-271 \t47653.2 \t1994-03-19\r\nJourney's End \t7x20 \t40277-272 \t47751.2 \t1994-03-26\r\nFirstborn \t7x21 \t40277-273 \t47779.4 \t1994-04-23\r\nBloodlines \t7x22 \t40277-274 \t47829.1 \t1994-04-30\r\nEmergence \t7x23 \t40277-275 \t47869.2 \t1994-05-07\r\nPreemptive Strike 7x24 \t40277-276 \t47941.7 \t1994-05-14\r\nAll Good Things.7x25/26 40277-747 \t47988.0 \t1994-05-23","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c58fc676300ae61371dad7ecb5df89828df2f974","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+-+The+Next+Generation+-+Season+7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c58fc676300ae61371dad7ecb5df89828df2f974","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,143,198,118,48,10,230,19,113,218,215,236,181,223,137,130,141,242,249,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
