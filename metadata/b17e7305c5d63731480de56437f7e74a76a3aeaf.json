Deceptively simple, ever so addictive.\r\n\r\n- Three worlds to explore with endless modes unlocking after each one\r\n- 4 Characters to upgrade, each with distinctive play styles\r\n- 18 Dungeons to fight through\r\n- Mini games to uncover, side-quests to undertake\r\n- Bosses to fight, merchants to trade with, and secrets to uncover\r\n\r\nDeveloped by Red Winter, a two man studio based in Russia, Dungelot: Shattered Lands is the third part in the popular series, and tasked the player with traversing randomly-generated dungeons, smashing enemies in the face and hunting for the keys that will allow you to venture even further. Dungelot originally became a cult hit thanks to its addictive &quot;just one more go&quot; feel, and with Shattered Lands, the Dungelot formula has now been fully realized.\r\n\r\nDungelot: Shattered Lands will feature dozens of hours of content, with three worlds to explore, hundreds of items, spells and enemies, and epic boss battles that will burn your face off.
