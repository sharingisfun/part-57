(AMG)\r\n\r\n\r\nGrabs your attention with the soulful opening &quot;Dark Night&quot; twang vocals and steel guitar riffs by The Blasters. Drags you thru the bar fights and nights with &quot;Mexican Blackbird&quot; and &quot;Texas Whiskey&quot;. \r\nThen, when you've said to hell with it all, I'm goin' to Mexico, you really party down with the &quot;Angry Cockroaches&quot; by Tito &amp; the Taruantulas. Interspersed are vocal gags by Cheech Marin (not for Womens' Libbers or children under 18). \r\nThe catchy remake of &quot;Mary had a Little Lamb&quot; will have you disinvited to the PTA if the Teacher hears you singing it! \r\nThe guitars alone are worth the price, even if it would be better without Cheech's vulgarity (Customer from Amazon)\r\n\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/5oFBxlG.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n01.
