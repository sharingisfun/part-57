It allows you to make backups of current SPD data and to flash SPD timings from backupfiles of both original settings and custom ones you have saved. This program is quite powerful. I know it works with everything from SDR RAM to DDR3 in many dimm form factors (haven't tried DDR4 just yet). If you somehow mess your ram up one way is to install another stick of ram that works and then install the one with that is not working and usually the computer will run the slower or more relaxed timings of the working stick allowing you to get into windows and flash working settings to the messed up DIMM module. I hope you all enojoy this program","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21673c4795dadbf4fcb4b9944c5f881926e42efe","amp;dn":"SPD+Tool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21673c4795dadbf4fcb4b9944c5f881926e42efe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,103,60,71,149,218,219,244,252,180,185,148,76,95,136,25,38,228,46,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
