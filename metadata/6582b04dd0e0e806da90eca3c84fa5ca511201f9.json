He uses the Lighthouse churches, which he founded, as an example because many people wonder how it is possible to sustain churches that are all over the world with him being in Ghana. He says that much of the system depends on loyalty. The ministers are loyal to the Lord, to him and to the Lighthouse vision and that is why it works. Find everything about loyalty and disloyalty in this book and how to recognize a loyal or disloyal assistant but also about the good fruit of loyalty. Surely it is God's desire that a pastor become a leader who has a purpose and is consistent in his personal life and ministry. With this book leaders will have the needed tools to achieve victory and confidence. This book has been praised by many pastors and church leaders and words such as Â“life-changing bookÂ”, Â“tremendous impactÂ” and Â“apostolic foundationÂ” have been used to describe Loyalty and Disloyalty","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6582b04dd0e0e806da90eca3c84fa5ca511201f9","amp;dn":"Loyalty+and+Disloyalty.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6582b04dd0e0e806da90eca3c84fa5ca511201f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,130,176,77,208,224,232,6,218,144,236,163,200,79,165,202,81,18,1,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
