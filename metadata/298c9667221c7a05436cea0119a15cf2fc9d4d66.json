One is Hindu and the other Muslim. Bishwanath Mitra (Shankar Chakraborty) has a son Raonojoy (Dev), who instead of joining his father's business would rather be a singer and is a member of a musical group called Garage band. The other mafia ganglord is Sabir Khan (Koushik Sen) who is assisted by Tayyiab (Jishu Sengupta). Sabir ali has a daughter, Zulekha aka Julie (Rittika Sen). Ronojoy and Julie meet, fall in love at first sight and carry on with a secreat affair, given the enmity of the two families. They are found out and Julie is forbidden to step out of the house. They make a secret assignment with the help of her music teacher..\r\n\r\nComments:\r\nAparna Sen has tried to make a musical, in the manner of &quot;The West Side Story&quot; of the Romeo &amp; Juliet tale, and if we are to speak plainly, has made a hash of it. Her characters speak in rhyme (remember Gupi Bagha in Hirok Rajar deshe?) but the actors don't seem too comfortable. Besides she tries the impossible - get Dev to act - and fails. The others are passable, with veterans like Koushik Sen doing a reasonable job. Unfortunately, Sen also keeps prolonging the movie, until at the end of 150 minutes, you end up yawning!\r\nThe music itself is only passable. The only pieces of music that make an impression are the folk tunes. For a musical, the score is a disappointment. One expects a lot from him, but in this movie he disappoints. Cinematography is good but mot imaginative. We have seen Shirsha Ray do so much better.\r\nOverall, watch the film for its experimental nature - a musical. Then put it aside and forget it. It won't take too much of an effort to do that.\r\n\r\nUploader's Notes:\r\nA very good quality DVD with some minor flaws. As is usual these days, the DVD came with an yellow tint. We have tried to reduce it and bring out the inherent details. In the process, the cinematography by Sirsha Ray comes out much better.\r\n\r\nThe 10-bit compressibility and the magic of x265, allowed us to compress the video to just 700 MB and yet maintain full quality. The 720p version, with full DTS sound is just 2.5 GB.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this rip (and all HEVC rips) will not play on most stand-alone devices.
