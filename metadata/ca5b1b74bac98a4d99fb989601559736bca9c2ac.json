Realizing she is late to babysit her infant half-brother Toby, she\r\nrushes home and is confronted by her stepmother Irene before she and her father\r\nRobert leave for dinner. Sarah realizes that Toby is in possession of her treasured\r\nteddy bear Lancelot. Frustrated by this and his constant crying, Sarah rashly wishes\r\nToby be taken away by the Goblin King Jareth, a character in the play she is rehearsing.\r\nShe is shocked when Toby disappears and the Goblin King confronts her and transports\r\nher to his kingdom. He refuses to return the baby, but gives Sarah thirteen hours to\r\nsolve his Labyrinth and find him before Toby is turned into a goblin. Sarah meets the\r\ndwarvish Hoggle, who aids her in entering the Labyrinth, but a talking worm inadvertently\r\nsends her in the wrong direction..\r\n\r\nBox Office\r\n\r\nBudget: $25,000,000 (estimated)\r\nOpening Weekend: N/A\r\nGross: $12,729,917 (USA)\r\nWorldwide: N/A\r\nFilming Dates: 15 April 1985 - 6 September 1985\r\n\r\n\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/MDEVxa9.png  \r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/ap7Rfp4.png\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/ILKi1Q8.jpg\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/svEQUDL.jpg\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/IuH02dN.jpg  \r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/dAec0sC.jpg\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091369/\r\n\r\n:: General ::\r\n\r\nFormat: Matroska/MKV\r\nFile Size: 9.83 GiB\r\nOverall Bit Rate: 13.9 Mbps\r\nFormat profile:   \r\nDuration: 01:41:03\r\nSample: Yes\r\nSubtitles: English / Polski\r\nChapters: Yes\r\nEncoded By oneanight\r\n\r\n:: Video Info ::\r\n\r\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\r\nWriting library: x264\r\nVideo bitrate: 11.5 Mbps\r\nResolution: 1920 X 816 pixels\r\nAspect ratio(AR): 2.35:1\r\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\r\n\r\n:: Audio Info ::\r\n\r\nFormat profile: DTS / AC3\r\nAudio Bit rate 1: 1509 Kbps\r\nAudio Bit rate 2: 448 Kbps Kbps\r\nCompression mode: Lossy/Lossy\r\nBit rate mode Constant/Constant\r\nAudio Language: English / Polski\r\nSampling rate: 48.0 KHz Bit depth 24 bits/48.0 KHz\r\nChannel positions: Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\r\nChannels:1 &amp; 2 6 channels 5.1 Surround\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca5b1b74bac98a4d99fb989601559736bca9c2ac","amp;dn":"Labyrinth+-+%5B1986%5D+1080p+BDRip+x264+DTS+AC3+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca5b1b74bac98a4d99fb989601559736bca9c2ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,91,27,116,186,201,138,77,153,251,152,150,1,85,151,54,188,169,194,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
