ARG Medical introduce us to their new FRECs course and, following Travis Haley's endorsement, we examine the validity of using airsoft as a training tool for real world situations. Trampas takes a Benelli M4 and turns it into a kicking up-specced M1014, we put Pencott under the spotlight and check out the latest from Claw Gear.
