The passage of Russian laws permitting the importation and storage of high-level radioactive material (primarily spent nuclear fuel from reactors) has engendered interest from a number of foreign governments, including the U.S., in exploring the possibility of transferring material to Russia on a temporary or permanent basis. The workshop focused on the environmental aspects of the general location and characteristics of a possible storage site, transportation to and within the site, containers for transportation and storage, inventory and accountability, audits and inspections, and handling technologies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9ed25ccf6544909e6d334691c4c9c9585dbaead","amp;dn":"An+International+Spent+Nuclear+Fuel+Storage+Facility","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9ed25ccf6544909e6d334691c4c9c9585dbaead","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,237,37,204,246,84,73,9,230,211,52,105,28,76,156,149,133,219,174,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
