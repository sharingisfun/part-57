It's an experimental project ripped straight from the new remastered Blu-ray to see how far an efficient, high-quality release could be pushed with all modern tools, as Dragon Ball Z episodes are notorious among filesharing networks, usually for being crappy rips with little attention paid to quality.\r\nThe remastered source has been stripped of all noise and finally redrawn to fit 16:9 widescreen rather than being cropped to fit widescreen like the shitty Kai so-called remastered release.\r\nI'm disappointed to say that they used automatic algorithms for denoising and fixing film damage so the oversmoothing pretty much killed all high-definition detail. The videos were safely downsized to 480p without really losing anything.\r\nIntros have been cut because they are all the same and a waste of space in the end.\r\nSubtitles are included which are English subtitles of the Japanese dub. There were no subs of the English dub.\r\nAll my processing has been purely automatic with little intervention, thus there has been no thorough double-checking of quality whatsoever","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6c9142db75d53eade8b594e7f5ead48d3983c0e","amp;dn":"Dragon+Ball+Z+Remastered+Episodes+1-68%5BEng%2BJap%5Dx264-XP17","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6c9142db75d53eade8b594e7f5ead48d3983c0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,201,20,45,183,93,83,234,222,139,89,78,127,94,173,72,211,152,60,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
