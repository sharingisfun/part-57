Season 7 is such a weird-ass season of â€˜Buffy.â€™ First of all, it drags like crazy. They talk about nothing for like, five episodes. I kind of hate this season. Even the dialogue doesnâ€™t feel up to the usual snuff. Everything becomes about Spike, for some reason, and characters I cared about are given anti-climactic brush-offs. Itâ€™s very unsatisfying. The show also introduces like, 500 new characters, shoves them into Buffyâ€™s house and then doesnâ€™t explain anything about them except for a few.\r\n\r\nThat said, Faith comes back! We see Angel again briefly. Thereâ€™s a lot of good series wrap up. But I just wasnâ€™t into this season. There are good episodes but thereâ€™s a lot of talk and very little action or scenes to back it up. â€œConversations With Dead Peopleâ€ is one of my favorite episodes of anything ever. I also like how The First makes a comeback, but unfortunately he/she was never as evil or scary as I wanted him/her to be. Buffy gets it right when she calls The First a â€œtaunt.â€ It just seems to make people creeped out, but never actually causes that much harm â€” except Xanderâ€™s eyeball RIP.\r\nWillow\r\nBuffy\r\n\r\nWillowâ€™s arc has been one of the best on â€˜Buffyâ€™ and maybe on all of TV. From her mousy geekiness in season 1 until the powerful, fully-realized witch she is at the end of the show, Willow has certainly grown the most.\r\n\r\nLook, we all miss Tara and I definitely think that could have been handled better. I also really resent them replacing her with some more conventionally attractive, younger girl and then ramping up the lesbian sex scenes. (Obvious and cliche.) But Willow herself does a lot of amazing stuff in Season 7 so I forgive her.\r\n\r\nAnd in the finale, when Kennedy says, â€œYouâ€™re a goddess,â€ itâ€™s the perfect summation of Willowâ€™s story. She is a goddess â€” and a powerful, amazing one at that. (Can you tell sheâ€™s my favorite character?)\r\nAnya\r\nBuffy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTC Mark","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6afe7a41487f825c674f716ccc7053ed12d3d617","amp;dn":"Buffy+The+Vampire+Slayer+-+Seasons+7+and+Pilot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6afe7a41487f825c674f716ccc7053ed12d3d617","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,254,122,65,72,127,130,92,103,79,113,108,204,112,83,237,18,211,214,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
