From a 'girl in pearls' shoot in Yorkshire to a historic mansion in Dorset, via Lindisfarne castle and a family farm in Somerset, this series captures the glory and eccentricity of the men and women who live the rural life.\r\n\r\n2)  Part 2 \r\nFor almost 120 years, Country Life magazine has been the property bible for anyone looking to buy a grand country house. Jane Treays spends a year visiting cottages, manor houses and castles through the eyes of the magazine - and seeing how people live in them. Properties range from a crumbling historic mansion in Oxfordshire and a glorious Scottish estate basking in its Â£13million refurbishment, to the inherited turrets of Picton Castle in south-west Wales, and the noisy environment of a huntsman's 18th-century kennels and cottage..\r\n\r\n3)  Part 3 \r\nFilm-maker Jane Treays concludes her exploration of the British obsession with architecture, gardens and landscape, spending a year alongside the staff of Country Life magazine. From a romantic Manor House in Somerset, steeped in First World War history to fishing the silvery waters of North Uist, and stamping the grouse moors of Scotland, the publication's editorial team still have time to find the Gentleman of the Year and Britain's Naughtiest Dog - eventually tracked down in a Wiltshire valley.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/55/Land-of-Hope-and-Glory-British-Country-Life-Series.1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c3/Land-of-Hope-and-Glory-British-Country-Life-Series.1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/ff/Land-of-Hope-and-Glory-British-Country-Life-Series.1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/eb/Land-of-Hope-and-Glory-British-Country-Life-Series.1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e6/Land-of-Hope-and-Glory-British-Country-Life-Series.1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/da/Land-of-Hope-and-Glory-British-Country-Life-Series.1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d1/Land-of-Hope-and-Glory-British-Country-Life-Series.1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/13/Land-of-Hope-and-Glory-British-Country-Life-Series.1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/61/Land-of-Hope-and-Glory-British-Country-Life-Series.1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2c/Land-of-Hope-and-Glory-British-Country-Life-Series.1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/27/Land-of-Hope-and-Glory-British-Country-Life-Series.1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ab/Land-of-Hope-and-Glory-British-Country-Life-Series.1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/de/Land-of-Hope-and-Glory-British-Country-Life-Series.1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e1/Land-of-Hope-and-Glory-British-Country-Life-Series.1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b0/Land-of-Hope-and-Glory-British-Country-Life-Series.1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/35/Land-of-Hope-and-Glory-British-Country-Life-Series.1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 2990 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 3\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.29 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b072w04k","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1c61e8ede3fa758b09001a4d373e4774b438bf9","amp;dn":"BBC+Land+Of+Hope+And+Glory+British+Country+Life+Series+1+1of3+72","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1c61e8ede3fa758b09001a4d373e4774b438bf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,198,30,142,222,63,167,88,176,144,1,164,211,115,228,119,75,67,139,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
