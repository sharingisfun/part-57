The last two were post-series.\r\n\r\nEverything in boring color.\r\n\r\nDr. Mark Sloan is a doctor at Community General Hospital, and he is a consultant for the police department. His son Steve Sloan is a detective for the department. He and his father, along with emergency room resident Dr. Jesse Travis and Dr. Amanda Bentley, who is the pathologist at the hospital help to solve some very strange murder cases in Diagnosis Murder.\r\n\r\nTrivia: Look for the Sloan's Liniment signs in Dr. Sloan's office and at his Malabu home (starting 3rd season)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8aec9bf60aa7c69c3af24eb192196bcf7d35fd01","amp;dn":"Diagnosis+Murder++8+Seasons+%2B+5+TV+Movies+%2B+Pilot+%28spinoff%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8aec9bf60aa7c69c3af24eb192196bcf7d35fd01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,236,155,246,10,167,198,156,58,242,78,177,146,25,107,207,125,53,253,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
