Warren Gatland's side are looking to claim a fifth successive triumph over Les Bleus after a hard-fought 20-13 victory in Paris last year. France haven't won in Cardiff since 2010 when they went on to win the title, but they are a different proposition in this campaign under new head coach Guy Noves. Martyn Williams, Thomas Castaignede and Ali Williams offer expert analysis from the studio, while Brian Moore and Jonathan Davies are in the commentary box alongside Eddie Butler.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: h264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: 7858Kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1080\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 50i/MBAFF\r\nAudio Codec: AC3\r\nAudio Bitrate: 384Kbps CBR 48KHz\r\nAudio Channels: 6\r\nRun-Time: 151 mins\r\nPart Size: 9.17 GB\r\nSource: HDTV\r\nContainer: TS\r\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aced220c76d0c7282b4e1727ed716d74b21c4f21","amp;dn":"Six.Nations.Rugby.2016.02.26.Wales.v.France.1080i.h264-NX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aced220c76d0c7282b4e1727ed716d74b21c4f21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,237,34,12,118,208,199,40,43,78,23,39,237,113,109,116,178,28,79,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
