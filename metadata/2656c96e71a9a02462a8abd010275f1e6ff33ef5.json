Cobaltâ€™s slo-mo mechanic lets you perform moves that other games canâ€™t comprehend. Play though the story and discover answers to mysterious questions including: What happened to the humans? Why am I riding a space hamster? How is my cyborg head so good at deflecting bullets? Multiplayer is a less cryptic, though equally enjoyable affair: face off against friends and enemies in local or online multiplayer, learn the intricacies of over 80 maps and 67 weapons, and dominate the leaderboards","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2656c96e71a9a02462a8abd010275f1e6ff33ef5","amp;dn":"Cobalt+v1.3.1+Gold","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2656c96e71a9a02462a8abd010275f1e6ff33ef5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,86,201,110,113,169,160,36,98,168,171,208,16,39,95,30,111,243,62,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
