The pair decide to go to Aspen, Colo., to return the money, unaware that it is connected to a kidnapping. As Harry and Lloyd -- who has fallen in love with Mary -- are pursued across the country by hired killers and police, they find both their friendship and their brains tested.&quot;\r\n\r\nDumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd (2003) - &quot;After years of homeschooling, dim-bulb teen Harry Dunne (Derek Richardson) finally makes the leap to public school and meets the equally intellectually challenged Lloyd Christmas (Eric Christian Olsen). The duo land in a &quot;special needs&quot; class created by Principal Collins (Eugene Levy) in order to bilk money from parents to fund his condo in Waikiki, Hawaii. His corruption is discovered by Jessica (Rachel Nichols), a fellow student who asks Harry and Lloyd to help her prove Collins' guilt.&quot;\r\n\r\nDumb and Dumber To (2014) - &quot;In need of a new kidney and having learned that he has a long-lost daughter, dimwit Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels) snaps his equally cretinous pal, Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey), out of an apparent fugue state to accompany him on a journey to find her. The witless wonders criss-cross the country using whatever mode of transportation they can find, ultimately arriving at the one place on Earth where they least belong: a summit of the world's most brilliant minds.&quot;\r\n\r\n_____________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nName (Title): Dumb and Dumber - Movie TRILOGY\r\n\r\nCategory Type: Movie Series\r\n\r\nLength (Duration): Varies by Movie\r\n\r\nYear(s): 1994, 2003, 2014\r\n\r\nStarring: Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels\r\n\r\nGenre(s): Comedy\r\n\r\nResolution: 720p\r\n\r\nRip Type (Source): BrRip\r\n\r\nCodec Type: x264\r\n\r\nFormat of File(s): MP4(s)\r\n\r\nAudio Format &amp; Language(s): AC3 &amp; AAC (English)\r\n\r\nSubtitles: YES.\r\n\r\nChapters: No.\r\n\r\nIMDB Link(s): \r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109686/\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0329028/\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2096672/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37c96ac2771edb5434b7634ebe8ed0a48e7b1e5f","amp;dn":"DUMB+and+DUMBER+-+1994%2C2003%2C2014+Movie+TRILOGY+-+720p+BrRip+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37c96ac2771edb5434b7634ebe8ed0a48e7b1e5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,201,106,194,119,30,219,84,52,183,99,78,190,142,208,164,142,123,30,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
