Many stand in their way: an abandoned songstress, the noble's own murderous younger brother, desperate beggars, rough slavers, and the pair's own differing agendas. Through it all, a bond forms between the two, and what will happen at journey's end becomes anyone's guess. Director: Sheng Ding. Stars: Jackie Chan, Leehom Wang, Sung-jun Yoo .\r\n\r\nIn Mandarin with hardcoded English subtitles\r\n\r\nPlease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:716216b892d44d22f61b60d68e9ae2fe2d903587","amp;dn":"Little+Big+Soldier+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"716216b892d44d22f61b60d68e9ae2fe2d903587","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,98,22,184,146,212,77,34,246,27,96,214,142,154,226,254,45,144,53,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
