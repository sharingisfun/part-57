Salena Zito, Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. Lara Brown, George Washington University.\r\n\r\nâ€œâ€¦Itâ€™s important, in the wake of this fracas, to remember that initially all Fields wanted was an apology. Instead her integrity, and the veracity of the Washington Postâ€™s account, were called into question. So she filed a police report because, in the face of unabashed lying by the Trump campaign, it was the only way to â€œproveâ€ her story true.\r\n\r\nâ€œNow that thereâ€™s a legal paper trail, in what borders on the absurd, Donald Trump continues to support Lewandowski. â€œLook at tapes-nothing there!â€ he tweeted after the news broke, with a link to a recording that shows his campaign manager grabbing Fields clear as day.\r\n\r\nâ€œA few hours later Trump even went on offense, tweeting a photo of Fields holding a pen close to his jacket. â€œWhy is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference? What is in her hand??â€ In another he asked, â€œWhy is she allowed to grab me and shout questions? Can I press charges?â€ In an interview this evening, he asked why she didnâ€™t scream if she was bruised by the altercation, as she tweeted.\r\n\r\nâ€œPerhaps the most befuddling thing politically is that Trump continues to defend this guy. Other political candidates would distance themselves from such actions. Theyâ€™d say their campaign doesnâ€™t condone violence. Any other political candidate, after an apology and investigation, would fire Lewandowski (and the calls to fire Lewandowski are growing louder every day).\r\n \nhttp://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/29/donald-trump-campaign-manager-assault-charge-but-alleged-victim-is-being-punished","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45e3dc42ca385b4979f34a628a2915006057b10a","amp;dn":"wisconsin-trump-fields-lewandowski.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45e3dc42ca385b4979f34a628a2915006057b10a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,227,220,66,202,56,91,73,121,243,74,98,138,41,21,0,96,87,177,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
