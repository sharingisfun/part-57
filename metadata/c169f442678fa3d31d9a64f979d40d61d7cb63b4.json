Since the band's formation in 1989, its line-up remained unchanged until the dismissal of Weiland in 2013, who was replaced by Linkin Park vocalist Chester Bennington.[5] In 2015, Bennington left the band to focus solely on Linkin Park.[6][7] On December 3, 2015, Weiland was found dead on his tour bus prior to a performance with his band The Wildabouts. In 2016, the band launched an online audition for a new lead vocalist.[8]\r\n\r\nGenres\t\r\nAlternative rock, grunge, hard rock, alternative metal,[1][2] neo psychedelia,[3] funk rock \r\n\r\n\r\nMembers\t\r\nDean DeLeo\r\nRobert DeLeo\r\nEric Kretz\r\n\r\nPast members\t\r\nScott Weiland\r\nChester Bennington","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c169f442678fa3d31d9a64f979d40d61d7cb63b4","amp;dn":"Stone+Temple+Pilots+-+Thank+You+%28320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c169f442678fa3d31d9a64f979d40d61d7cb63b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,105,244,66,103,143,163,211,29,154,100,249,121,212,13,97,215,203,99,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
