Family matriarch Mags Bennett (Margo Martindale) and her three sons Dickie (Jeremy Davies), Coover (Brad William Henke), and Bennett Police Chief Doyle (Joseph Lyle Taylor) plan to expand their marijuana business into Crowder territory following Bo's death, as Boyd has proven somewhat reluctant to follow in his father's footsteps. Raylan gets involved in the struggle between the two criminal organizations, and because of a long-standing feud between the Givens and Bennett families centering on an incident between Raylan and Dickie in their youth (an incident which left the latter with a lame leg), things begin to become very complicated, with their pasts catching up with them. Meanwhile, an effort by a mining conglomerate to secure access rights to the mountain results in Raylan and Boyd becoming involved on opposite sides of the operation, and provokes a local backlash against the Bennetts after Boyd reveals Mags' secret involvement in negotiations with the conglomerate, to the detriment of her neighbors.\r\n\r\n\r\n14 \t1 \t&quot;The Moonshine War&quot; \t\r\n15 \t2 \t&quot;The Life Inside&quot; \t\r\n16 \t3 \t&quot;The I of the Storm&quot; \t\r\n17 \t4 \t&quot;For Blood or Money&quot; \t\r\n18 \t5 \t&quot;Cottonmouth&quot; \t\r\n19 \t6 \t&quot;Blaze of Glory&quot; \t\r\n20 \t7 \t&quot;Save My Love&quot; \t\r\n21 \t8 \t&quot;The Spoil&quot; \t\r\n22 \t9 \t&quot;Brother's Keeper&quot; \t\r\n23 \t10 \t&quot;Debts and Accounts&quot; \t\r\n24 \t11 \t&quot;Full Commitment&quot; \t\r\n25 \t12 \t&quot;Reckoning&quot; \t\r\n26 \t13 \t&quot;Bloody Harlan&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:750734721fd8d34dcf362bc1607cefdc778d0aa2","amp;dn":"Justified+-+Season+2+of+6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"750734721fd8d34dcf362bc1607cefdc778d0aa2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,7,52,114,31,216,211,77,207,54,43,193,96,124,239,220,119,141,10,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
