Jean-Pierre Aumont, Gene Kelly, Cedric Hardwicke, Peter Lorre\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035769/\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cross of Lorraine is the tragic story of the capitulation of the French Army, told through the confusion, dejection and apprehensions of a small group of poilus who surrender against their better judgment and are carted off to a German prison camp. Slowly they realize the true intent of the Nazis.\r\n\r\nThis is a harshly realistic film drama, a reflection of life unsullied by the usual softening up ministrations of Hollywood. From a script dripping with pungent dialogue, director Tay Garnett has trained an uncompromising camera on scenes of brutality and cowardice within a Nazi prison camp. No, The Cross of Lorraine is not a pretty picture, nor is it entertainment in the accepted sense of the term. But it is, for all that, a very heartening picture, a stirring restatement of the spirit of freedom within Frenchmen which no Nazi heel can crush forever.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 640x480, 23.976 fps, 1844 Kbps, 01h30m27s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, optional Russian subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/jmd17evut/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/mxoa4eo87/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/ta3fe8raf/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/552pwj6zr/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/7l4jadp2f/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83f7385b9ef72fbab183670b94f90e6b9636cc83","amp;dn":"The+Cross+of+Lorraine+%281943+-+USA%29+%5BPeter+Lorre%5D+WWII","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83f7385b9ef72fbab183670b94f90e6b9636cc83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,247,56,91,158,247,47,186,177,131,103,11,148,249,14,107,150,54,204,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
