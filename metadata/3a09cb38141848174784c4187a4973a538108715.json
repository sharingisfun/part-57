It all started when a pregnant Julia woke up in her apartment flanked by the bloodied bodies of her former lovers Nahuel and Romiro. Subsequently sent to a prison for mothers and pregnant convicts, Julia railed against the system by withdrawing into her own world. Upon giving birth, Julia realizes just how difficult it could be to raise a son in prison, but each day her feelings for the boy swell stronger within her. Later, when Julia pays a visit to Romiro in the men's prison, it becomes obvious that the couple's feelings for one another are just as muddled as the events of that fateful night back in Julia's apartment. \r\n\r\n\r\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / French","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a09cb38141848174784c4187a4973a538108715","amp;dn":"Leonera+aka+Lion%27s+Den+2008+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a09cb38141848174784c4187a4973a538108715","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,9,203,56,20,24,72,23,71,132,196,24,122,73,115,165,56,16,135,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
