A heartwarming science fiction adventure movie that pits a delirious dentist, a pencil-weilding accountant and a shapely space woman against an egotistical intergalactic evangelist. Something strange is going on in the backwoods and hills of West Virginia. The once cheerful townsfolk are becoming mindless, moronic automatons. Is it an alien invasion? No, it's much worse than creatures from space . . . it's PREACHERS from space, and they've arrived under the leadership of the evil Reverend Lash, who is using his faithful following to control the minds of the hapless Earthlings. They're from out of town, she's from outer space and together, they're all going out of their minds.\n\nNow celebrating 40 years of filmmaking, Troma Entertainment Inc. is the longest running independent movie studio in North America. In addition to commercial success, Troma enjoys a wealth of critical appreciation, exemplified by Troma retrospectives sponsored by the American Cinematheque, CinÃ©mathÃ¨que FranÃ§aise, the British Film Institute, the American Film Institute and many others. Many of today's major stars, directors and writers began their careers in Troma movies, and many more have grown up with them, absorbing the influence of the Tromatic touch.\n\n\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 636x482, 29.970 fps, 1430 Kbps, 01h38m55s\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 44100 Hz, stereo, 256 kbps\n\nDVDRip, English audio, no subtitles\n\ncover:\nhttp://postimg.org/image/3t6a8is81/\n\nscreenshots:\nhttp://postimg.org/image/4rozthrdf/\nhttp://postimg.org/image/9p2keltcj/\nhttp://postimg.org/image/yxne89yab/\nhttp://postimg.org/image/rqlpcendf/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c8b1dabb96cfc49c618abf0b4f8e04af2888475","amp;dn":"Strangest+Dreams%3A+Invasion+of+the+Space+Preachers+%281990%29+Troma","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c8b1dabb96cfc49c618abf0b4f8e04af2888475","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,139,29,171,185,108,252,73,198,24,171,240,180,248,224,74,242,136,132,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
