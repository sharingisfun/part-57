Rightfully so, according to them:\r\n\r\nâ€œWe have a completely new window opened to look at the universe. The 2Ist century will be the century of gravitational wave astronomy. A new golden age is beginning.â€\r\n\r\nWhat are gravitational waves?\r\n\r\nGravitational waves are tiny ripples in space and time. You can envision gravitational waves by imagining them as sound since they have the same vibratory qualities. In a sense, you can hear or feel gravitational waves but not see them. Scientists have been on a quest for decades to find substantial proof of these â€œoscillating distortions in the geometry of spacetimeâ€ or gravitational waves, to aid them in more cosmic discoveries. It wasnâ€™t until February 11th, 2016 that scientists reported they had found the evidence they had been extensively searching to find.\r\nIFO\r\nDiagram of LIGO\r\n\r\nUsing the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) located partly in Livingston, Louisiana and partly in Hanford, Washington, scientists have spotted gravitational waves in action. The sensitive detectors built with two two and a half mile long arms with strong mirrors at the end of each arm. Beams of light are reflected upon a series of mirrors to return to where it came. When a gravitational wave interferes with the light pattern, very minutely squeezing and pulling the light from the beam, the detector is set off to alert scientists of the finding.\r\n\r\nOn September 14th, 2015, LIGO detected the waves coming off of the in-spiral and merging of two black holes that happened ages ago sending ripples out into the universe. This discovery was the final variable in proving Einsteins theory of General Relativity.\r\n\r\nIn this report we will cover:\r\n\r\nWhy scientists want to find gravitational waves. How will the discovery be used?\r\nHow is the finding of gravitational waves connected to the Antichristâ€™s goal of world domination?\r\nWhat effect will this have on the world as a whole?\r\nHow is this connected to time travel?\r\nThe spiritual motive and meaning","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16cff00cd0240b3ef5de1cd42b471be2a9e14fe3","amp;dn":"Freedom+Fighter+Times+-+Scientists+find+inter-dimensional+window","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16cff00cd0240b3ef5de1cd42b471be2a9e14fe3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,207,240,12,208,36,11,62,245,222,28,212,43,71,27,226,169,225,79,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
