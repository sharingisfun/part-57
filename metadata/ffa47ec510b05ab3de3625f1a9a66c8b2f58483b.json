Recommended for the permanent library of all fantasy readers.â€ \r\n--Books and Movie Reviews, Roberto Mattos \r\nThe #1 Bestseller! \r\nFrom #1 Bestselling author Morgan Rice comes the debut of a dazzling new fantasy series. A QUEST OF HEROES (BOOK #1 IN THE SORCERERâ€™S RING) revolves around the epic coming of age story of one special boy, a 14 year old from a small village on the outskirts of the Kingdom of the Ring. The youngest of four, the least favorite of his father, hated by his brothers, Thorgrin senses he is different from the others. He dreams of becoming a great warrior, of joining the Kingâ€™s men and protecting the Ring from the hordes of creatures on the other side of the Canyon. When he comes of age and is forbidden by his father to try out for the Kingâ€™s Legion, he refuses to take no for an answer: he journeys out on his own, determined to force his way into Kingâ€™s Court and be taken seriously. \r\n \r\n..[/color][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://s10.postimg.org/l1kh8y3gp/cooltext1925887515.gif[/img][/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffa47ec510b05ab3de3625f1a9a66c8b2f58483b","amp;dn":"A+Quest+of+Heroes+%28Book+1+in+the+Sorcerers+Ring%29+Epub+DTW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffa47ec510b05ab3de3625f1a9a66c8b2f58483b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,164,126,197,16,176,90,179,222,54,37,241,169,166,108,139,47,88,72,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
