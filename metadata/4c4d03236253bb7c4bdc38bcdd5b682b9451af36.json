Similarly, it will be systems, not aliens who will first visit earth. Systems digitally encode the rules, logic, and intelligence of corporations, and manage businesses, countries and science. As the world and businesses become more competitive, very few corporations can keep pace with developing and maintaining complex systems like operating systems and browsers. Moreover, systems do not breathe alone in the digital world; they also socially interact with businesses, users, science, and even art.\r\n\r\nWhat does it take to design, write and maintain complex systems? This book cracks the mysteries of designing and maintaining complex systems using the history and evolution of systems, business fundamentals, secrets of Investment Banking trading systems, complexities of the brain and immune system, and more than one hundred creative artworks. The author explains the fundamentals of systems using factual technology stories, then delves into the systems design and problems using four Investment Banking trading systems, and finally comes up with an innovative design to create and manage better systems using his model &quot;Fine System.&quot; The authorâ€™s approach is a stark contrast to previously written books that just explain the history of technology but leave readers to come up with their own solutions. This book is a refreshing upgrade on purely technical books that explain the technology with lots of drab definitions and code and lack business knowledge.\r\n\r\nImagination is the root of innovation. Systems have become an integral part of our lives such that not only software programmers, but also users are coming up with creative solutions for world problems. This book is indispensable to everyone who wants to weave the intelligence of humans, business, and nature into systems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c4d03236253bb7c4bdc38bcdd5b682b9451af36","amp;dn":"Systems+-+Brains+of+Corporations+%282016%29+%28Pdf%2C+Epub%2CMobi%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c4d03236253bb7c4bdc38bcdd5b682b9451af36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,77,3,35,98,83,187,124,75,220,56,188,221,91,104,43,148,81,175,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
