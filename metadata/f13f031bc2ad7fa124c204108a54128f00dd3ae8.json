Because you like ...\r\n1. Grace Park\r\n2. the characters Athena and/or Boomer\r\n3. the new BSG and you want to watch fanedits and extras featuring Eights\r\n\r\nThese videos are a collection of Grace Park Battlestar Galactica Scenes, Extras, Fanedits, and an interview. They are encoded using x265 HEVC for the video and HE-AAC for the audio. CRF constant quality was used for each encode though multiple CRF values were tried for different videos to get the best combination of quality and compression.\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt; Athena Bonus Scenes: 2 excellent Athena scenes\r\n02m13s Deleted.Scene.s3e18.Athena.Confronts.Cally.480p.2ch\r\n01m39s Extended.Scene.s4e18.Athena.Confronts.Chief.1080p.6ch\r\nThese two scenes show Athena separately confronting Cally and Chief. The Cally video was a 360p deleted scene and had extra processing applied to it to maximize it's quality. It still doesn't look great but both actresses do an excellent job.\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt; BluRay Extras: edits that only include Grace Park\r\n02m26s part1.720p-1080p.2ch\r\n15m12s part2-part6.480p.2ch\r\nThese are edits of all the Extras scenes with Grace Park from the Blu-Rays, clips from the Battlestar Galactica Blu-Ray box set extras covering all 4 seasons and the movies Razor and The Plan. There are 6 files to account for the different resolutions and aspect ratios.\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt; Compilation Fanedits: Every Eight scenes from the Previously Seen and Drum intros\r\n09m56s Previously.Seen.Eights.Montage.1080p.6ch\r\n01m21s Taiko.Drum.Montage.Athena.and.Helo.1080p.6ch\r\n00m40s Taiko.Drum.Montage.Boomer.and.Chief.1080p.6ch\r\nThese are fanedits of all the Eight scenes during the Previously On and Taiko Drum intros. The editing was simply a chronological clip compilation for each.\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt; Boomer Fanedits: 2 short fanedits of memorable Boomer scenes\r\n03m11s s1e12.Baltar.Counsels.Suicidal.Boomer.1080p.6ch\r\n01m20s s1e13.Boomer.Thanks.Adama.1080p.6ch\r\nThe first fanedit shows Boomer contemplating suicide as she cleans her pistol when Baltar walks into her barracks. He proceeds to very carefully counsel Boomer, subtly encouraging her to kill herself. This is an extremely intimate and intense scene with a shocking ending. The editing consisted of removing Head Six's dialog though she can still be seen in some shots. The goal was to focus on just Boomer and Baltar.\r\nThe second fanedit is of Boomer returning from successfully destroying the Basestar where she saw many copies of herself confirming she was a Cylon. As Adama thanks her, Boomer's &quot;Thank you sir&quot; is followed by the biggest surprise in sci-fi TV history. The editing consists of focusing on just Boomer and Adama by removing many of the the Lee and Adama shots from the sequence.\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt; Grace Park Interview: no longer on SyFY.com\r\n18m42s SyFy.Q.and.A.2006-09.288p.2ch\r\nThis is an excellent fan Q&amp;A Grace did at the SyFy offices in 2006 which is no longer available at SyFy.com. Note, the source was 384x288 VP6 video so the quality is not that great though the content is excellent.\r\n\r\nPlease check out other releases of Battlestar Galactica, Gotham, MST3K, Rifftrax, DC Comics, documentaries, Star Trek Enterprise and more at:\r\n  https://thepiratebay.se/user/bsg4you/  \r\n  https://kat.cr/user/bsg4you/uploads/  \r\nand leave any corrections, criticism, comments and requests.\r\n\r\nThanks, bsg4you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f13f031bc2ad7fa124c204108a54128f00dd3ae8","amp;dn":"Battlestar+Galactica+Grace+Park+Extras+Fanedits+x265+HEVC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f13f031bc2ad7fa124c204108a54128f00dd3ae8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,63,3,27,194,173,127,161,36,194,4,16,138,84,18,143,0,221,58,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
