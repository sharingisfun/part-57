If anything, Threat to Survival proves that Shinedown still have plenty of gas left in the tank, and while the occasional foray into the shallower end of the mainstream may divide some listeners, there's enough here to keep longtime followers satiated (and probably a little curious/nervous as to what the future holds) until the next ride.\r\n\r\nAllMusic Review by James Christopher Monger\r\n\r\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.\r\nHHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.\r\nWe hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\r\n\r\n\r\nTrack Listing....:\r\n01.Asking for it                                        [03:31]\r\n02.Cut the cord                                         [03:42]\r\n03.State of my head                                     [03:26]\r\n04.Outcast                                              [03:26]\r\n05.How did you love                                     [03:08]\r\n06.It all adds up                                       [03:51]\r\n07.Oblivion                                             [03:58]\r\n08.Dangerous                                            [03:52]\r\n09.Thick as thieves                                     [03:54]\r\n10.Black cadillac                                       [03:28]\r\n11.Misfits                                              [04:06]\r\n________\r\n40:22 min\r\n66,10 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31e76335725ba9edb0296e9d835955424567fa21","amp;dn":"Shinedown-Threat_To_Survival-%28Retail%29-2015-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31e76335725ba9edb0296e9d835955424567fa21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,231,99,53,114,91,169,237,176,41,110,157,131,89,85,66,69,103,250,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
