The Rolling Stones American Tour in 1981 was the most successful tour of that year taking a then record $50 million dollars in ticket sales. The tour was in support of the critically and commercially successful â€œTattoo Youâ€ album. There were fifty dates on the tour which ran from Philadelphia at the end of September through to Hampton, Virginia on the 18th and 19th of December. The show on December 18th, which was also Keith Richardsâ€™ birthday, was the first ever music concert to be broadcast on television as a pay-per-view event. The footage has now been carefully restored and the sound has been newly mixed by Bob Clearmountain for this first official release of the show.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Mick Taylor, Bill Wyman, Charlie Watts \r\nDIRECTOR......: Hal Ashby\r\nGENRE.........: Concert\r\nIMDB link.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0255556\r\nRUNTIME.......: 2h 29mn\r\nSIZE..........: 4.30GB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: x264 (  )\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1424x1080i\r\nBITRATE.......: 2500 Kbps\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 29.970 fps\r\nAUDIO.........: DTS 5.1 1500 Kbps\r\nSOURCE........: Blu Ray\r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2016-03-11\r\nENCODING NOTE.: The Blu Ray was sourced from SD NTSC video which appears to have been transferred improperly and has a plethora of hard-coded interlacing artifacts.
