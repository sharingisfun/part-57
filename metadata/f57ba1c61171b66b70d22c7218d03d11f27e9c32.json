A week following the death of his beloved wife Ruth, he suddenly gets a mysterious package from his close friend Max (Academy Award (R) Winner Martin Landau), containing a stack of money and a letter detailing a shocking plan. Both Zev and Max were prisoners in Auschwitz, and the same sadistic guard was responsible for the death of both their families-a guard who, immediately after the war, escaped Germany and has been living in the U.S. ever since under an assumed identity. Max is wheelchair-bound but in full command of his mental faculties; with his guidance, Zev will embark on a cross-continental road-trip to bring justice once and for all to the man who destroyed both their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguages: English / German\r\n\r\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f57ba1c61171b66b70d22c7218d03d11f27e9c32","amp;dn":"Remember+2015+BRRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f57ba1c61171b66b70d22c7218d03d11f27e9c32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,123,161,198,17,113,182,107,112,210,44,114,24,208,61,17,242,126,156,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
