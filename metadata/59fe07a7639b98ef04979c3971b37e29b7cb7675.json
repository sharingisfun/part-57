However, the straight BBC rip had a couple of problems. The first was the fact that it was a NTSC-&gt;PAL conversion which had been done incorrectly, resulting in blended/junk frames. Another problem was the PAL speed. Finally, the color was off, which frequently happens during the NTSC-&gt;PAL process.\r\n\r\nI took this rip and distributed it to a couple of AV techs, who helped by removing the junk frames, correcting the color, and formatting it to a ready-to-burn NTSC DVD. I figured I would post it here so that anyone who wants it can have it. :)\r\n\r\nI took this torrent and converted it from a DVD ISO to an MP4 for my AppleTV, iPad, and iPhone. \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7558961/Song_of_the_South_-_Restored_and_Cleaned_Up_BBC_HD_Broadcast","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59fe07a7639b98ef04979c3971b37e29b7cb7675","amp;dn":"Song+of+the+South+-+Restored+and+Cleaned+Up+BBC+HD+%28MP4+Conv%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59fe07a7639b98ef04979c3971b37e29b7cb7675","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,254,7,167,99,155,152,239,4,151,156,57,113,179,126,41,183,203,118,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
