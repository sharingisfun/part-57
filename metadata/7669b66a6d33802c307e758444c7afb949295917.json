Add to that a lilting, seductive voice, \r\nand KoitÃ© basically has all the goods in one package. \r\nAt the same time, this is no compromise album in search of stardom in the West. \r\nThis is very much the real Mali deal, as is apparent in the last few cuts, \r\nwhen the band switches to a more Wassoulou approach \r\n(from the south of the country, and typified by singers like Oumou Sangare), \r\nwith its harsher, drier tone. But by then you've been won over. \r\nKoitÃ© is, without doubt, a major talent...\r\n\r\nHabib KoitÃ© &amp; Bamada - Baro (2001) mp3 192kbps\r\n\r\nBatoumambe \t  4:13\r\n\r\nKanawa \t          5:21\r\n\r\nWari \t          4:16\r\n\r\nSin Djen Djen \t  5:06\r\n\r\nCigarette Abana   3:27\r\n\r\nWoulaba \t  3:40\r\n\r\nBaro              5:06\r\n\r\nSambara \t  4:18\r\n\r\nRoma \t          4:12\r\n\r\nTere \t          6:08\r\n\r\nMali Sadio \t  4:01\r\n\r\nTakamba \t  5:40\r\n\r\nSinama Denw \t  7:15","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7669b66a6d33802c307e758444c7afb949295917","amp;dn":"HABIB+KOIT%26Eacute%3B+%26amp%3B+Bamada+-+Baro+%282001%29+mp3+192","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7669b66a6d33802c307e758444c7afb949295917","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,105,182,106,109,51,128,44,48,126,117,132,68,199,175,185,73,41,89,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
