The film is both a piece of art in its own right and a recording of Sachsâ€™ historic piece, Space Program 2.0: MARS, which opened at New Yorkâ€™s Park Avenue Armory in 2012. For Space Program 2.0: MARS, Sachs and his team built an entire space program from scratch. They were guided by the philosophy of bricolage: creating and constructing from available yet limited resources. They ultimately sent two female astronauts to Mars in search of the answer to humankindâ€™s ultimate questionâ€¦ are we alone? Directed by Van Neistat, A Space Program is a captivating introduction to Sachsâ€™ work for the uninitiated, and required viewing for his longtime fans.\r\n\r\nDirector: Van Neistat\r\n\r\nWriters: Van Neistat, Tom Sachs\r\n\r\nActors: Mary Eannarino, Sam Ratanarat\r\n\r\nGenre: Science Fiction, Documentary\r\n\r\nRun Time: 1 hour 12 minutes\r\n\r\nStudio: Â© 2016 Zeitgeist Films","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30f285af743d417636cda9e598bd4dac1540aeb0","amp;dn":"+Program.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%231+%5BHD%5D+%282016%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30f285af743d417636cda9e598bd4dac1540aeb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,242,133,175,116,61,65,118,54,205,169,229,152,189,77,172,21,64,174,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
