It's what can probably be called his real operatic masterpiece. Martinu was an extremely prolific Czech composer who has, sadly, not received much attention. He lived in the early 1900's.\r\n\r\nThis performance is quite good.\r\n\r\nMain Personnel:\r\n\r\nConductor: Jaroslav Krombholc\r\nChorus Master: Milan Maly\r\nJulietta: Maria Tauberova\r\nMichel: Ivo Zidek\r\nPerformed by the Prague National Theatre Chorus and Orchestra\r\n\r\nThis is my first torrent, hope y'all enjoy it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44696e2fac39be17ac91c85c1322e1bb14770a6b","amp;dn":"Martinu+Bohuslav+-+Julietta+%281964+cond.+Jaroslav+Krombholc%29+m4a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44696e2fac39be17ac91c85c1322e1bb14770a6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,105,110,47,172,57,190,23,172,145,200,92,19,34,225,187,20,119,10,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
