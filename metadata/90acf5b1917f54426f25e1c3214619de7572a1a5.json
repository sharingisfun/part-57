This is typically accomplished via choices forced on the player. In some of the most complex visual novels, there are dozens of these choices and multiple endings. I call Quantum Conscience &quot;experimental&quot; because it seeks to do away with these choices. Outside of the very first few minutes of the game, in which the player chooses to be a male or female protagonist and answers some questions about their background, there are no forced choices. Rather, the player character--a soldier in the far-flung future--is given the power to, at any time, read the minds of the other characters","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90acf5b1917f54426f25e1c3214619de7572a1a5","amp;dn":"Quantum+Conscience","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90acf5b1917f54426f25e1c3214619de7572a1a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,172,245,177,145,127,84,66,111,37,225,195,33,70,25,222,117,114,161,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
