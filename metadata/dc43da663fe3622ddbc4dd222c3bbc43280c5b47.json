Each book provides a concise account of the basic principles underlying a given subject, embodying an independent-learning philosophy and including worked examples. Students will be able to assess their understanding through use of exam-style questions, which include answers. By concentrating on one core topic per book, lecturers can recommend only those texts relevant to their particular curriculum and ensure students gain better value for money. In addition, the &quot;one topic, one book&quot; approach, ensures that the series is adaptable to chemistry courses across a variety of institutions.Focused approach, one topic per book for adaptation across a variety of syllabuses.Texts encourage self-study with worked examples.Exam-style questions and model answers to highlight understanding.Competitively priced for student budgets.Layout clear for ease of use.\r\n\r\nSeries DOI: 10.1039/2045-662X\r\nPrint ISSN: 2045-6611\r\nSeries ISSN: 2045-6611","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc43da663fe3622ddbc4dd222c3bbc43280c5b47","amp;dn":"Tutorial+Chemistry+Texts+%5BUpdated+at+2016.03.23%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc43da663fe3622ddbc4dd222c3bbc43280c5b47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,67,218,102,63,227,98,45,219,196,221,34,44,59,188,67,40,12,91,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
