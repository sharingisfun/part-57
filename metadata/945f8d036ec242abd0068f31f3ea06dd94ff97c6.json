The Southern Bite is a celebration of those traditions and recipes every Southern family is proud to own. Itâ€™s the Pecan Chicken Salad thatâ€™s mandatory for every family reunion and the hearty Goulash, so comforting after a long day. Itâ€™s the Glazed Ham that makes its way to the Easter table every year.\r\n\r\nIf youâ€™re lucky enough to hail from the South, youâ€™ll no doubt find some familiar favorites from your own family recipe archives, along with a whole slew of surprises from Southern families a lot like yours! Thereâ€™s Turnip Green Dip for your next party, Chicken Corn Chowder for those chilly fall nights, and Cornbread Salad for when you really need to make an impression.\r\n\r\nNo matter whatâ€™s cooking, Littleâ€™s goal is the same: to revel in the culinary tradition all Southerners share. These are the recipes that bring us together and the meals our families will cherish for generations to come","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:945f8d036ec242abd0068f31f3ea06dd94ff97c6","amp;dn":"The+Southern+Bite+Cookbook+%40+Stacey+Little","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"945f8d036ec242abd0068f31f3ea06dd94ff97c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,95,141,3,110,194,66,171,208,6,143,49,243,234,6,221,148,255,151,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
