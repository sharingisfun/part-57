It is based on the British sitcom Man About the House.\r\n\r\nThe story revolves around three single roommates: Janet Wood (Joyce DeWitt), Chrissy Snow (Suzanne Somers), and Jack Tripper (John Ritter), who all platonically live together in a Santa Monica, California,[1] apartment building owned by Stanley and Helen Roper. Following Somers' departure, Jenilee Harrison joined the cast as Cindy Snow, who was soon replaced by Priscilla Barnes as Terri Alden. After the Ropers left the series for their own sitcom, Don Knotts joined the cast as the roommates' new landlord Ralph Furley.\r\n\r\nThe show, a comedy of errors, chronicles the escapades and hijinks of the trio's constant misunderstandings, social lives, and financial struggles, such as keeping the rent current, living arrangements and breakout characters. A top ten hit from 1977 to 1983, the series has remained popular in syndication and through DVD releases","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0279c4a20d81c7143b9cffead12d0f3853bf89b","amp;dn":"Three%27s+Company","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0279c4a20d81c7143b9cffead12d0f3853bf89b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,39,156,74,32,216,28,113,67,185,207,254,173,18,208,243,133,59,248,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
