Our seats got moved \r\nand got put on top row behind the stage.  Bad news \r\nwas we stared at Elton's back but very close.  \r\nThere also was a huge screen right in front \r\nof us which was what I taped from instead of his \r\nback.  Not a single person walking in front of us, \r\nno problems at all. Great video and great concert","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2042da16f12366fcadcdd051b576dea1820e8fec","amp;dn":"Elton+John+2016-03-22+Covelli+Center%2C+Youngstown%2C+Ohio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2042da16f12366fcadcdd051b576dea1820e8fec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,66,218,22,241,35,102,252,173,205,208,81,181,118,222,161,130,14,143,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
