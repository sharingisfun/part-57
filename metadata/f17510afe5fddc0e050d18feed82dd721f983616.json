Starring Prunella Scales and Joan Sanderson, it had started on BBC Radio 4 in 1985, finishing in 1989. It was written by Simon Brett. After Henry was made for the ITV network by Thames Television.\r\n\r\nThe BBC was reluctant to produce After Henry for television, so in 1988 after the third radio series Thames Television did so. The show was surprisingly popular, attracting over 14 million viewers. A second television series was shown during the same months as the fourth radio series with, in many cases, both radio and television episodes being broadcast on the same nights. The fourth television series was broadcast from July 1992, after the death of Joan Sanderson, who had died on 24 May.\r\n\r\nSarah France is the 42-year-old widow of a GP, Henry. She lives in an often volatile family situation with her mother, Eleanor Prescott, and her daughter, eighteen-year-old Clare France, with both of whom she shares a house. After Henry's death, all three members of the family have to find a way to cope with each other as best they can.\r\n\r\nSarah often finds herself in the middle of things, usually figuratively, but always literally, given that she has her daughter living upstairs and her mother in the basement flat. Eleanor is ruthlessly cunning and takes every opportunity to get one over on Sarah. Anything told to Eleanor will spread by word of mouth throughout an extensive network of the elderly of the area, or the &quot;geriatric mafia&quot;. Clare is trying to be independent of her mother, though often has to come running back in times of crisis.\r\n\r\nThe relationships between the three women change constantly through each episode. Sometimes mother and daughter ally against grandmother, sometimes mother and grandmother go against daughter, but usually grandmother and granddaughter gang up on the long-suffering Sarah, whose one haven is Bygone Books, the remarkably unsuccessful second-hand bookshop where she works for Russell, who dispenses in turn sympathy and wisdom. Most of the time, Russell sees the women's relationships second-hand through Sarah, although he isn't opposed to taking the occasional more active role when necessary. In turn, Sarah can see some of Russell's difficulties of living with a gay partner in 1980s London suburbia, while at the same time seeing Russell's relationship as the one perfect marriage she knows.\r\n\r\nThe adaptation for television allowed more to be seen of some of the more minor characters in the radio series, with appearances by some who had appeared only by reputation on the radio. These included Eleanor's best friend and rival Vera Poling, and Valerie Brown on the pension counter's sister Mary. In the television adaptation, Sarah also gained an on-off partner in Sam Greenland.\r\n\r\nMany of the exterior locations for the TV series were shot in the village of Thames Ditton in Surrey. Also Twickenham.\r\n\r\n\r\nStats From Episode 1...\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\nComplete name                  : E:TV SeriesAfter HenryAfter.Henry.S01E01.DVDRip-GJ69.mp4\r\nFormat                         : MPEG-4\r\nFormat profile                 : Base Media / Version 2\r\nCodec ID                       : mp42\r\nFile size                      : 306 MiB\r\nDuration                       : 24mn 22s\r\nOverall bit rate mode          : Variable\r\nOverall bit rate               : 1 755 Kbps\r\nEncoded date                   : UTC 2036-02-06 06:28:16\r\nTagged date                    : UTC 2036-02-06 06:28:16\r\nWriting application            : HandBrake 0.10.2 2015060900\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nID                             : 1\r\nFormat                         : AVC\r\nFormat/Info                    : Advanced Video Codec\r\nFormat profile                 :   \r\nFormat settings, CABAC         : Yes\r\nFormat settings, ReFrames      : 5 frames\r\nCodec ID                       : avc1\r\nCodec ID/Info                  : Advanced Video Coding\r\nDuration                       : 24mn 22s\r\nBit rate                       : 1 589 Kbps\r\nWidth                          : 640 pixels\r\nHeight                         : 516 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio           : 4:3\r\nFrame rate mode                : Constant\r\nFrame rate                     : 25.000 fps\r\nColor space                    : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling             : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth                      : 8 bits\r\nScan type                      : Progressive\r\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)             : 0.192\r\nStream size                    : 277 MiB (91%)\r\nWriting library                : x264 core 142 r2479 dd79a61\r\nEncoding settings              : cabac=1 / ref=5 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x113 / me=hex / subme=2 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=0 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=0 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=0 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=2 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=0 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=5 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=1 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=10 / rc=crf / mbtree=1 / crf=20.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=0 / qpmax=69 / qpstep=4 / vbv_maxrate=62500 / vbv_bufsize=78125 / crf_max=0.0 / nal_hrd=none / filler=0 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\r\nEncoded date                   : UTC 2036-02-06 06:28:16\r\nTagged date                    : UTC 2036-02-06 06:28:16\r\nColor range                    : Limited\r\nColor primaries                : BT.601 PAL\r\nTransfer characteristics       : BT.709\r\nMatrix coefficients            : BT.601\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nID                             : 2\r\nFormat                         : AAC\r\nFormat/Info                    : Advanced Audio Codec\r\nFormat profile                 : LC\r\nCodec ID                       : 40\r\nDuration                       : 24mn 22s\r\nBit rate mode                  : Variable\r\nBit rate                       : 160 Kbps\r\nChannel(s)                     : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions              : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate                  : 48.0 KHz\r\nCompression mode               : Lossy\r\nStream size                    : 27.9 MiB (9%)\r\nTitle                          : Stereo / Stereo\r\nEncoded date                   : UTC 2036-02-06 06:28:16\r\nTagged date                    : UTC 2036-02-06 06:28:16\r\n\r\nMenu\r\nID                             : 3\r\nCodec ID                       : text\r\nDuration                       : 24mn 22s\r\nLanguage                       : English\r\nEncoded date                   : UTC 2036-02-06 06:28:16\r\nTagged date                    : UTC 2036-02-06 06:28:16\r\nBit rate mode                  : CBR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f17510afe5fddc0e050d18feed82dd721f983616","amp;dn":"After+Henry+-+ITV+Sitcom+-+Complete+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f17510afe5fddc0e050d18feed82dd721f983616","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,117,16,175,229,253,220,14,5,13,24,254,237,130,221,114,31,152,54,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
