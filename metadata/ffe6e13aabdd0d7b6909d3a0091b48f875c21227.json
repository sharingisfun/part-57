Autumn is quickly approaching, and the spirits of fallen leaves are setting out on their journey home. Guide them by changing how the wind blows or by rebuilding the ground. Each spirit can be sacrificed to perform one of four actions â€“ build a bridge of leaves, create a blowing cloud, dig tunnels, or block wind currents in an area. Use your actions wisely or you will run out of spirits. In each level it's up to you to find your own creative solution on how to get the spirits to the goal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffe6e13aabdd0d7b6909d3a0091b48f875c21227","amp;dn":"Spirits","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffe6e13aabdd0d7b6909d3a0091b48f875c21227","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,230,225,58,171,221,13,123,105,9,211,160,9,27,72,248,117,194,18,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
