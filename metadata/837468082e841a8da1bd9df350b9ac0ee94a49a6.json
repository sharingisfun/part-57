But the showâ€™s subversiveness was spelled out by creator Joss Whedon in the opening scene, as a nervous blonde girl and a cocky, older-looking guy in a leather jacket break into Sunnydale High School late at night. The girl seems scared and keeps hearing noises. â€œWeâ€™re just going to get in trouble,â€ she tells him. â€œYou can count on it,â€ he replies, licking his lips. Finally, once sheâ€™s certain thereâ€™s no one else around, she reveals her distorted vampire features and sinks her teeth into his neck.\r\n\r\nIn its first two minutes, â€œWelcome to the Hellmouthâ€ establishes a universe, as the camera creeps slowly through a high school in the dark, lingering on skeletons in a classroom and shadows behind a door. But it also establishes a premiseâ€”that this is a show about female power. The pretty blonde, a vampire named Darla, isnâ€™t a victim but a predator, just as Buffy has strength and acuity that belie her looks. At the end of â€œThe Harvest,â€ the second part of the two-episode debut, Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) watches Buffy and her friends walk away, cheerily discussing the ways in which she stands between the world and its total destruction. â€œThe earth is doomed,â€ he says, wearily. It's this kind of assumptionâ€”that being young and frivolous and having profound influence are mutually exclusiveâ€”that Whedon would go on to dispel throughout Buffyâ€™s seven seasons.\r\n\r\nBuffy is also unique in that, as much as Sunnydale is a Hellmouth, high school","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:837468082e841a8da1bd9df350b9ac0ee94a49a6","amp;dn":"Buffy+The+Vampire+Slayer+-+Seasons+3+and+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"837468082e841a8da1bd9df350b9ac0ee94a49a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,116,104,8,46,132,26,141,161,189,157,243,80,185,172,14,233,74,73,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
