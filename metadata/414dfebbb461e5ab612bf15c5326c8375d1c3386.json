In some ways, he is slightly backward; but in most ways, he is surprisingly sharp for a Welsh bumpkin. He has a phobia about dead bodies but manages quite well with the aid of his three sons to whom he is devoted. Because death means business, he is constantly hoping for people to die.\r\n\r\nArwell Thomas (33 years old)\r\n\r\n    Of the sons, it is Arwell who seems closest to Ivorâ€”he often confides in his father about personal matters. He hopes to one day meet and marry someone with whom he can have children and build a life. But until he meets his wife-to-be, the main love in his life is his Fiat Panda.\r\n\r\nGwynne Thomas\r\n\r\n    Gwynne has a mental deficiency (on one occasion, he pulls one of his own teeth with a pair of pliers). Despite his subtle impairment, he receives no special treatment from Ivor and is expected to perform his duties regardless.\r\n\r\nPercy Thomas\r\n\r\n    Perhaps the sharpest of them all and with a devious streak. \r\n\r\nSeries 2\r\n\r\nAirdate in Britain \tEpisode Title\r\n\r\n22Â·1Â·2002 \t&quot;The Balls Of Doom&quot;\r\n29Â·1Â·2002 \t&quot;Polterghoost&quot;\r\n05Â·2Â·2002 \t&quot;A Pocket Full Of Gravel&quot;\r\n12Â·2Â·2002 \t&quot;Gwynne's Marvelous Medicine&quot;\r\n19Â·2Â·2002 \t&quot;Marooned&quot;\r\n26Â·2Â·2002 \t&quot;Dog Dago Afternoon&quot;\r\n05Â·3Â·2002 \t&quot;Moira Stewart &amp; The Clown Syndrome&quot;\r\n\r\nEnjoy ......I did :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:414dfebbb461e5ab612bf15c5326c8375d1c3386","amp;dn":"Fun.at.the.Funeral.Parlour.S02.PAL.DVDRip.DD2.0.x264-BTN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"414dfebbb461e5ab612bf15c5326c8375d1c3386","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,77,254,187,180,97,229,171,97,43,241,92,83,38,200,55,93,28,51,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
