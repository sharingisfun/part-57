Thompson as Silver Convention the group released this, their eponymously titled debut LP (titled &quot;Save Meâ€ outside of Germany) to great acclaim as the Euro-Disco sound made waves across the world with Giorgio Morodor, also based in Munich, surfing the highest.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ &quot;Save Meâ€ opens the album with its propulsive rhythms, sweeping horns and strings, yearning vocals and soulful sax solos. Follow up single &quot;Fly, Robin, Fly,â€ a minimal mid-tempo dancer with a very satisfying piano motif and intricate strings, gained heavy rotation on U.S. radio as well as in the clubs, eclipsing the success of â€˜Save Meâ€™ by hitting the top spot across the Billboard R&amp;B, Disco and Pop charts and again charting top 30 in the U.K., as well as taking home the Grammy for best R&amp;B Instrumental Performance. Other stand out tracks are the single â€˜Always Another Girlâ€™ , â€˜Tiger Babyâ€™ UK #41 and â€˜I Like Itâ€™ which show off the lush, string-laden Euro sound with Levay's arrangements tipping the hat to the likes of Gamble &amp; Huff and Barry White.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Reaching #1 and #10 on the U.S. R&amp;B and Pop album charts respectively SILVER CONVENTION (Save Me) has become a very influential album and is rightly regarded as a dance classic in many circles.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ BBR are proud to present this newly remastered and repackaged expanded edition.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Complete with extensive liner notes and the extended 12â€ versions of â€˜Fly, Robin, Flyâ€™ and â€˜Tiger Babyâ€™, SILVER CONVENTION is essential listening for all R&amp;B, Soul, Pop, Disco and Dance fans out there!\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01.
