Danny has since remarried and prepares to move. \r\nHe and Rebecca has gotten a new job offer to work in LA to start a new morning \r\nshow, Uncle Jesse heads to LA to be with Becky as well as start a new musical \r\njob, Nick &amp; Alex (the twins) are now in college, Uncle Joey has gotten a job as \r\na live comedian act in Las Vegas, Stephanie now has a successful DJ career, \r\ntaking her sister's name as &quot;DJ Tanner,&quot; and Michelle is out in New York \r\nfocusing on her fashion career (much to the family's chagrin). With the entire \r\nfamily taking major directions away from their house, Danny has opted to sell \r\ntheir home, ending the Tanner Household. However, fate would change with D.J.\r\n\r\nD.J. became an animal vet and started a family with her husband, Tommy Fuller \r\n(a firefighter). Together, they have three boys: Jackson, Max, and Tommy \r\nJunior. Unfortunately, Tommy died in the line of duty a year earlier and D.J. \r\nhas been taking refuge back at the Tanner House until she can figure things \r\nout. Too proud to admit she is struggling to find stability and balance within \r\nher life, she admitted her troubles to her baby and the family overheard her \r\nreal feelings and decided to help her; the house now belongs to D.J. and the \r\nFuller boys, making it the Fuller House.\r\n\r\nIn between, Kimmy Gibbler got married to Spanish car racer, Fernando, and the \r\ntwo have a daughter together, Ramona. Unfortunately, Fernando wasn't a loyal \r\nhusband and Kimmy has caught him cheating on her multiple times, prompting her \r\nto divorce him. However, despite the multiple infidelities, Kimmy still have \r\nfeelings for Fernando and he tries hard to win back Kimmy's feelings.\r\n\r\nWhen the entire clan heard of D.J.'s plight, the entire family suddenly \r\nvolunteered to stay behind to help D.J., but D.J. herself couldn't allow the \r\nentire clan to make such a sacrifice for her. However, Stephanie had no major \r\nobligations and decided to put her DJ career on hold to help D.J. manage the \r\nhouse. Shortly not long, Kimmy Gibber and Ramona, also moved together with the \r\nFuller family as additional support.\r\n\r\nLife would get interesting for D.J. when she meets Matt at the vet and her ex, \r\nSteve. Both men are interested in her and both are vying for her affection. \r\nD.J. herself has been undecided as she likes both men. Although it created a \r\nrift, the men agreed to give D.J. the time she needs to make a final decision.\r\n\r\nAs for Stephanie, despite have a party girl life style, she ultimately learned \r\nshe wanted more stability and helped D.J. out with the boys. Because of Tommy's \r\ndeath, she never had the chance to tell D.J. and the family that she discovered \r\nshe's incapable of having children. Struggling with the idea of never able to \r\nhave a family of her own, Stephanie takes some comfort she's helping D.J. raise \r\nthe Fuller boys as she attempts to find someone herself.\r\n\r\nThe story ends with Uncle Jesse and Aunt Becky coming back into town to renew \r\ntheir vows. Kimmy and Fernando recently got back together and Fernando promises \r\nto make things different; the two are doing a double-wedding with Jesse and \r\nBecky with Uncle Joey as the presider. With Kimmy back with Fernando, it would \r\nmean Ramona and Kimmy would leave to be with Fernando on his career on the \r\nracing circuit. However, in the final moments, Kimmy realizes her being with \r\nthe girls the the life she has built means a lot greater than following \r\nFernando's career; the two agreed to remain engaged, but not re-married until \r\nthey can sort out the details. As for D.J., she couldn't make a final decision \r\nbetween Steve and Matt; D.J. realizes she's still not ready for a relationship \r\nand decided to put things off with the both of them.
