Driven by a deep sense of duty and a love for his country, Damien abandons his burgeoning career as a doctor and joins his brother, Teddy, in a dangerous and violent fight for freedom. As the freedom fighters' bold tactics bring the British to breaking point, both sides finally agree to a treaty to end the bloodshed. But, despite the apparent victory, civil war erupts and the families, who fought side by side, find themselves pitted against one another as sworn enemies, putting their loyalties to the ultimate test.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubs srt: Portuguese / Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8151b952ae4043f0d5fc35e88f483bf0e68ac8b","amp;dn":"The+Wind+That+Shakes+the+Barley+2006+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8151b952ae4043f0d5fc35e88f483bf0e68ac8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,21,27,149,42,228,4,63,13,95,195,94,136,244,131,191,14,104,172,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
