It was written and directed by Jaco\r\nVan Dormael, produced by Philippe Godeau, and starred Jared Leto, Sarah Polley, Diane\r\nKruger, Linh Dan Pham, Rhys Ifans, Natasha Little, Toby Regbo and Juno Temple. The\r\nfilm tells the life story of Nemo Nobody, a 118-year-old man who is the last mortal\r\non Earth after the human race has achieved quasi-immortality. Nemo, memory fading\r\nrefers to his three main loves and to his parents' divorce and subsequent hardships\r\nendured at three critical junctions in his life: at age nine, fifteen, and thirty-four\r\nAlternate life paths branching out from each of those critical junctions are examined\r\nThe speculative narrative often changes course with the flick of a different possible\r\ndecision at each of those ages. The film uses nonlinear narrative and the many-worlds\r\ninterpretation style.\r\n\r\nBox Office\r\n\r\nBudget: $47,000,000 (estimated)\r\nOpening Weekend: $1,612 (USA) (1 November 2013)\r\nGross: $3,600 (USA) (29 November 2013)\r\nWorldwide: $2,331,721 (Worldwide) (30 May 2010)\r\nFilming Dates: 4 June 2007 - 17 December 2007\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that all screenshot was captured at 1080p, resized to 720p\r\nand then compressed using PNG to improve the loading time.\r\n \nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/2c0ce1e.png  \r\n \nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/41b8f7d.png\r\n \nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/59ac11a.png\r\n \nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/7103726.png\r\n \nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/8f66e29.png  \r\n \nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/a5b6105.png\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0485947/\r\n\r\n:: General ::\r\n\r\nFormat: Matroska/MKV\r\nFile Size: 13.0 GiB\r\nOverall Bit Rate: 12.0 Mbps\r\nFormat profile:   \r\nDuration: 02:35:45\r\nSample: Yes\r\nSubtitles: English\r\nChapters: Yes\r\nEncoded By oneanight\r\n\r\n:: Video Info ::\r\n\r\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\r\nWriting library: x264\r\nVideo bitrate: 10 MB\r\nResolution: 1920 X 816 pixels\r\nAspect ratio(AR): 2.35:1\r\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\r\n\r\n:: Audio Info ::\r\n\r\nFormat profile: DTS / AC3\r\nAudio Bit rate 1: 1509 Kbps\r\nAudio Bit rate 2: 448 Kbps Kbps\r\nCompression mode: Lossy/Lossy\r\nBit rate mode Constant/Constant\r\nAudio Language: English\r\nSampling rate: 48.0 KHz Bit depth 24 bits/48.0 KHz\r\nChannel positions: Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\r\nChannels:1 &amp; 2 6 channels 5.1 Surround\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f87c09e547bc0f00e06b227d7eddca100b8f0e7b","amp;dn":"Mr+Nobody+-+%5B2009%5D+1080p+BDRip+x264+DTS+AC3+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f87c09e547bc0f00e06b227d7eddca100b8f0e7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,124,9,229,71,188,15,0,224,107,34,125,126,221,202,16,11,143,14,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
