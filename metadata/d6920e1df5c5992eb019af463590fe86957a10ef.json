I then split it into hour long episodes to make the viewing experience manageable.  It is a great way to watch the films as there are plenty of storylines that happen concurrently.\r\n\r\nThis is a complete cut of the X-Men films from Fox (not including Deadpool &amp; Apocalypse of course).\r\n\r\nThe Fox X-Men Omnibus includes intercut scenes from the films:\r\nX-Men Origins: Wolverine\r\nX-Men First Class\r\nX-Men\r\nX2: X-Men United\r\nX-Men: The Last Stand\r\nThe Wolverine\r\nX-Men Days of Future Past\r\n\r\nAs I said, it is a very fun viewing experience and of course, everyone will have a different interpretation of how the X-Men Universe should go as far as chronology is concerned but this is a pretty meticulous cut.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy all the hard work and can help me seed this for others.\r\n\r\nI have completed the MCU's Phases 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 also and are all available on here as well","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6920e1df5c5992eb019af463590fe86957a10ef","amp;dn":"X-Men+Omnibus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6920e1df5c5992eb019af463590fe86957a10ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,146,14,29,245,197,153,46,176,25,175,70,53,144,254,134,149,122,16,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
