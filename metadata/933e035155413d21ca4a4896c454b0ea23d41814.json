On this informal set with his quartet (which also includes tenor-saxophonist Tim Warfield, his other musical son, guitarist Johnny DeFrancesco, and drummer Glenn Ferracone), Papa John mostly sticks to the blues and bluish material. In addition to a swinging version of &quot;Sunny,&quot; the gospel-ish &quot;People Get Ready,&quot; the funky &quot;160 Million Dollar Chinese Man&quot; (from the remake of Ocean's 11), and a vamp piece (&quot;What Happened&quot;), there are four blues at various tempos and levels of funk. Joey DeFrancesco makes guest appearances on two tracks (one apiece on trumpet and piano) and bassist Paul Klinefelter is on one number but otherwise the basic quartet is showcased romping and stomping out their brand of soulful blues.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nL Hammond, The Pirate Bay, where you'll find more jazz organ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:933e035155413d21ca4a4896c454b0ea23d41814","amp;dn":"Papa+John+DeFrancesco+-+Walking+Uptown+-+Jazz+Organ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"933e035155413d21ca4a4896c454b0ea23d41814","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,62,3,81,85,65,61,33,202,74,72,150,196,84,176,234,35,212,24,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
