Anamaria Marinca and Laura Vasiliu play, respectively, Otilia and Gabita, two female friends and students who share a Bucharest flat. They soon find themselves saddled with an overwhelming problem: Gabita is expecting. With abortion illegal in Romania at that time, the women seek an illicit termination at the hands of one Mr. Bebe (Vlad Ivanov) in a seedy Romanian hotel -- but Bebe refuses to accept money in return for his services and demands a certain &quot;alternate&quot; commodity instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Anamaria Marinca, Vlad Ivanov, Laura Vasiliu\r\nDIRECTOR......: Cristian Mungiu\r\nWRITERS.......: Cristian Mungiu, Razvan Radulescu\r\nGENRE.........: Drama \r\nRATING........: 7.9/10  40,097 votes\r\nMETASCORE.....: 97\r\nIMDB link.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1032846\r\nRUNTIME.......: 1h 48mn\r\nSIZE..........: 4.35GB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: x264 (  )\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x1080p\r\nASPECT RATIO..: 1.77:1\r\nBITRATE.......: 5000 Kbps\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 25 fps\r\nAUDIO.........: Romanian DTS 5.1 755 kbps\r\nSOURCE........: 4 luni, 3 saptamÃ¢ni si 2 zile (2007) 1080p BluRay DD 5.1 x264-EA\r\nSUBTITLES.....: ARA, ENG, FRE, PER, SPA \r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2014-11-09\r\nENCODE NOTE...: The source was passed off as a 17GB BluRay rip but no BluRay has ever been released.
