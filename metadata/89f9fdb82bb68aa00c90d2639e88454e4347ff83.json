Kenji Kenmochi (Ganjiro Nakamura) is the older and increasingly impotent husband of young Ikuko (Machiko Kyo). He is desperate to regain his virility and when injections fail to do the trick, he discovers by spying on his daughter and her lover that jealousy will arouse him. Determined to succeed, he connives to bring his wife and his daughter's lover together -- so he can become jealous and sexually virile again. Unfortunately for Kenji, his plan has tragic consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89f9fdb82bb68aa00c90d2639e88454e4347ff83","amp;dn":"Kagi+aka+Odd+Obsession+1959+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89f9fdb82bb68aa00c90d2639e88454e4347ff83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,249,253,184,43,182,138,160,12,144,210,99,158,136,69,78,67,71,255,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
