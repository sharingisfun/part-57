The mice escape onto a log in the river and think theyâ€™ve escaped danger until, plunging into the water, they are pursued by an even greater dangerâ€“â€“a monstrous fish! A nail-biting chase ensues, where itâ€™s certain the mice are goners. In desperation they cry out for Theo to save them, which he does, and uses the occasion to teach about Salvation. In the Shoebox Bible Theatre section Theo takes us on a journey along the â€œRomans Road,â€ where we learn how to be saved.\r\n\r\nTotal Running Time: Approx. 11 mins.\r\n\r\nFormat MP4\r\nCodec H.264\r\nHigh Def - 1280x720\r\nFile size: 411.38 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00866ce2bbefc25f5dfca36159bd900894d4e6cd","amp;dn":"Theo+Presents+-+Salvation%2C+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00866ce2bbefc25f5dfca36159bd900894d4e6cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,134,108,226,187,239,194,95,93,252,163,97,89,189,144,8,148,212,230,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
