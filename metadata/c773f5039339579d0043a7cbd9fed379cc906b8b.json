The Rygaards are back in full force with all three generations of loggers on the site, fighting to regain the King of the Mountain crown. Papac Alaska is moving on to their final section, dubbed &quot;The Mother Lode&quot;, but will this be the ultimate test for the worn out crew? Down in Louisiana, Gary and Eddie are about to see if their gamble to try swamp logging has paid off. Just across the swamp, Shelby is trying to finish his hundred thousand board foot order, but only has a few hours left. He must call in reinforcements to come up with his plan of attack. Meanwhile, David Zitterkopf must come up with a unique plan to hit the bullseye and finish his job.
