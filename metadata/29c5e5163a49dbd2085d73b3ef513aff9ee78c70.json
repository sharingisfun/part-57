Iyiâ€™s clansmen, believing the desperate ronin is merely angling for a new position, try to force his hand and get him to eviscerate himselfâ€”but they have underestimated his beliefs and his personal brand of honor. Winner of the Cannes Film Festivalâ€™s Special Jury Prize, Harakiri, directed by Masaki Kobayashi is a fierce evocation of individual agency in the face of a corrupt and hypocritical system.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29c5e5163a49dbd2085d73b3ef513aff9ee78c70","amp;dn":"Harakiri+1962+BRRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29c5e5163a49dbd2085d73b3ef513aff9ee78c70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,197,229,22,58,73,219,210,8,93,115,179,239,81,58,255,158,231,140,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
