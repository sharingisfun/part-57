We first \r\n\r\nlived in downtown Saint Louis, then to the West side of Saint Louis, MO.   Scheduled to graduate May \r\n\r\n13, 2016 alongside of my twin brother Rashad whom we call Ra-Ra. I have always been a very out spoken \r\n\r\nperson, who has always enjoyed music. One day I was just free styling to a beat and I recorded it, so \r\n\r\nmy big sister Courtnei asked my mother, mama have you heard Shana's song and mama said no so she played \r\n\r\nit for my mama and it's been work ever since, my mama played it for my dad, then he played it for his \r\n\r\nfriends and I have been doing this thing every day!!  I sing about what I know and even though I'm \r\n\r\nstill a child technically I understand that I am also an endangered species I have buried more of my \r\n\r\nfriends in my short life than my parents have in their entire life!!!
