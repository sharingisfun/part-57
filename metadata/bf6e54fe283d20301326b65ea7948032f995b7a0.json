An incredible popular tale of early Christian glory and persecution at the hands of the Roman Emperor, Nero, the book was translated into 48 languages and in the first year following its publication sold more than 800,000 copies in France and Britain alone. \r\nThe beautiful Lygia - a Christian, and hostage of Rome - becomes the object of Vinicius' love - but she refuses his advances. Vinicius' friend - Petronius - tries to manipulate Nero, who has authority over all Roman hostages, to give Lygia to Vinicius - but Lygia is taken into hiding by Christians. Marcus Vinicius decides to find her and force her to be his wife. He goes to a Christian meeting along with Croton (a gladiator) to find her.  After following her from the meeting, Marcus tries to take her, but Ursus - a strong man and friend of Lygia - kills Croton...\r\nRome catches fire on the Emperors order, when Nero leave the city for a while. At the suggestion of Nero's wife, the Christians are blamed for the fire, providing a long series of cruel spectacles to appease the crowd. In one of the spectacles, Ursus faces a bull carrying Lygia on its back...\r\n\r\nCAST\r\n\r\nPaweÅ‚ DelÄ…g as Marcus Vinicius\r\nMagdalena Mielcarz as Lygie Callina\r\nBogusÅ‚aw Linda as Petronius\r\nMichaÅ‚ Bajor as Nero\r\nJerzy Trela as Chilon Chilonides\r\nDanuta Stenka as Pomponia Graecina\r\nFranciszek Pieczka as Saint Peter\r\nKrzysztof Majchrzak as Tigellinus\r\nRafaÅ‚ Kubacki as Ursus\r\n\r\nDirected by: Jerzy Kawalerowicz\r\nWrited by: Jerzy Kawalerowicz (based on the book of Henryk Sienikewicz)\r\nMusic by:\tJan Kaczmarek\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nGENERAL\r\nfile size: 1.37 GiB / duration: 2h 40mn / overall bit rate: 1 219 Kbps\r\nFormat: AVI (Audio Video Interleave) / Writing library: XviD 1.2.0SMP\r\n\r\nVIDEO\r\nFormat: MPEG-4 Visual / profile: Advanced    / Codec ID: XviD\r\nWidth: 512 pixels / Height: 288 pixels / Bit rate: 764 Kbps\r\nFrame rate: 25.000 fps / Display aspect ratio: 16:9\r\n\r\nAUDIO\r\nFormat: AC-3 (Audio Coding 3) / extension: CM / Codec ID: 2000\r\nChannels: 6 channels / Channel positions: Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\r\nBit rate: 448 Kbps / Sampling rate: 48.0 KHz / Bit depth: 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf6e54fe283d20301326b65ea7948032f995b7a0","amp;dn":"Quo+Vadis+%2A2001%2A+%5BDVDRip%5D%5BXviD%5D%5BAC3%5D%5BPL%2Bmulti-language+subtitles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf6e54fe283d20301326b65ea7948032f995b7a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,110,84,254,40,61,32,48,19,38,182,94,167,148,128,50,249,149,183,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
