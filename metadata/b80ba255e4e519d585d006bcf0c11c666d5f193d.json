Production for the album was also contributed by DJ Khalil, Jellyroll, Jonathan &quot;J.R.&quot; Rotem, Mr. Porter, Nottz, Reefa, Ervin &quot;E.P.&quot; Pope and D-Roc, among others.\r\n\r\nDoctor's Advocate debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, selling over 358,000 copies in its first week, making it Game's second number one album in a row.\r\n\r\nGuests featured on Doctor's Advocate include Busta Rhymes, Kanye West, Nas, Nate Dogg, Snoop Dogg, Tha Dogg Pound, Jamie Foxx and Xzibit.\r\n\r\nUpon its release, the album received favorable reviews, with music critics praising the album's production. Game made a point to prove that he could still make good music and be a successful artist, as he did on The Documentary, without the help from Dr. Dre or 50 Cent.\r\n\r\nAs with The Documentary, Doctor's Advocate was distributed in the United Kingdom by Polydor Records, which is the British distributor for Interscope-Geffen-A&amp;M releases.\r\n\r\nGame later called Doctor's Advocate the best album of his career (2012)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b80ba255e4e519d585d006bcf0c11c666d5f193d","amp;dn":"The+Game+-+Doctor%27s+Advocate+%282006%29+%5BMP3+320+kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b80ba255e4e519d585d006bcf0c11c666d5f193d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,11,162,85,228,229,25,213,133,208,6,188,240,193,28,102,109,95,25,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
