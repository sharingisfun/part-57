And so is Aj--the waif, the mind reader, the prophet--when she one day finds a man who wants to stay hidden.\r\n\r\nIn the next few weeks, they will all be swept together to decide the fate of the nation.\r\n\r\nRiver of Gods teems with the life of a country choked with peoples and cultures--one and a half billion people, twelve semi-independent nations, nine million gods. Ian McDonald has written the great Indian novel of the new millennium, in which a war is fought, a love betrayed, a message from a different world decoded, as the great river Ganges flows on. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Jonathan Keeble\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eae7fd35ebdfaa56c3c2b84a2726696cfa274c97","amp;dn":"Ian+McDonald+-+River+of+Gods+%28India+2047+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eae7fd35ebdfaa56c3c2b84a2726696cfa274c97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,231,253,53,235,223,170,86,195,194,184,74,39,38,105,108,250,39,76,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
