It was produced by Jack Boswell and\r\nBill Bessey who also produced albums by The Plastic Cloud, The Nihilist Spasm Band and Reign Ghost.  The Country Cougars were the house band at the after-hours club The Matador where they backed up many country stars who would go over there after their shows were finished and sometimes perform - the Matador was later the site of music videos filmed by KD Lang, Leonard Cohen and Blue Rodeo. They backed Waylon Jennings at a concert in Toronto's Riverdale Park - they opened for him and remained on stage. Several of Waylon's songs are on this album. They also played frequently at the Horseshoe Tavern. Band member Gerry Knight is father to country performer and recording artist JR Vautour.  Three of the band members were born in Minto New Brunswick which is also the birthplace of Oscar The Grouch.  Oscar is performed by Caroll Spinney who coincidentally was a close friend of Waylon Jennings","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3726e5b0fc52ce66900fc4bbc893d40b8f2e7ef4","amp;dn":"The+Country+Cougars","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3726e5b0fc52ce66900fc4bbc893d40b8f2e7ef4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,38,229,176,252,82,206,102,144,15,196,187,200,147,212,11,143,46,126,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
