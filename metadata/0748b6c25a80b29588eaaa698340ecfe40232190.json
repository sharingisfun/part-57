Featuring Hatfield and the North/National Health keyboardist Dave Stewart and Ã¼ber-bassist Jeff Berlin, the group only played a couple of live dates with original guitarist Allan Holdsworth, who left shortly afterwards and was replaced by &quot;The Unknown John Clarke. \r\n\r\nOne of those performances was recorded by the BBC for television broadcast and, while it's a scant 42-minutes long, it represents a high water mark for the British progressive/fusion scene of that timeâ€”or, for that matter, any other.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecorded by the BBC at Oxford Polytechnic UK, March 7th 1979.-\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01.
