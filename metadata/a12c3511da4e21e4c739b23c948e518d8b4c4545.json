Peace has reigned the land since then.  Everyone should live happily ever after, right?  WRONG!  Brona's spirit has been summoned back from the dead, and now he seeks revenge on those who destroyed him all those years ago.  \r\n\r\nFar away, in a land called Shady Vale, Jak Ohmsford (son of Shea) is upset after an argument with his father.  Jak yearns for excitement and adventure, while his father expects him to stay in Shady Vale to become an innkeeper.  Jak is trying to relax in his favourite spot by the stream, little knowing the adventure that awaits him.  \r\n\r\nAfter a confrontation with a fearsome monster, Jak meets a mysterious druid called Allanon, who informs him of Brona's return.  War and destruction is inevitable if Brona is not stopped.  So Jak is given the task of travelling to the neighbouring town of Leah to warn them of the impending danger.  From there, he learns of the Sword of Shannara - the only weapon that can defeat the evil Brona.  Jak, as heir to the Sword, must be the one to wield it.  And so begins Jak's adventure - he must face his destiny to become the Swordbearer, and destroy Brona once again.  Jak, and his friend Shella (from Leah) set out to retrieve the Sword from Tyrsis.  However, the Sword is broken, and must be re-forged.  If that's not bad enough, Jak needs magic from the Four Lands in order to re-forge the Sword.  He must re-unite the races of elves, trolls, dwarfs, and gnomes, and restore peace amongst them.  Only then can the Sword of Shannara be re-forged, and the evil Warlock Lord Brona destroyed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a12c3511da4e21e4c739b23c948e518d8b4c4545","amp;dn":"Shannara+%28MS-DOS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a12c3511da4e21e4c739b23c948e518d8b4c4545","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,44,53,17,218,78,33,228,199,57,178,60,148,142,81,141,139,76,69,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
