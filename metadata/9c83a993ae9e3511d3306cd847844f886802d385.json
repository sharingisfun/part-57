You will start with a specified amount of money and you use that money to purchase shares of players. You may buy and sell shares of players before each quarter is simulated and share price is set both based on the output of the player as well as the demand for that player. The game consists of a set amount of seasons (4 simulation quarters per season) and the goal is to accumulate the highest production score possible. In this version you are simply playing against yourself trying to achieve the score necessary to win (which you can change based on the difficulty level set) - you can also join a multiplayer season that is run by Wolverine Studios in order to compete against other players.\r\n\r\nInstructions: This is just a basic patch. Install The Sports Market as normal (http://www.wolverinestudios.com/downloads/TSM/TSMInstall.exe). Open the patch as admin. Click the &quot;Browse&quot; button and select the TSM.exe from the installation folder. Tick the &quot;Make Backup&quot; box if you want to make a backup of the original exe. Click the &quot;Crack&quot; button. That is it. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n    There are fairies at the bottom of our garden!\r\n    It's not so very, very far away;\r\n    You pass the gardner's shed and you just keep straight ahead --\r\n    I do so hope they've really come to stay.\r\n                                    - Rose Fyleman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c83a993ae9e3511d3306cd847844f886802d385","amp;dn":"The+Sports+Market+Patch+-+SoN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c83a993ae9e3511d3306cd847844f886802d385","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,131,169,147,174,158,53,17,211,48,108,216,71,132,79,136,104,2,211,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
