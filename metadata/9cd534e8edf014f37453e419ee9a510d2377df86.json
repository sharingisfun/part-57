Was planning on diving in the sea but there was a hurricane that ended the day before and that ended that idea . So my next bright idea was let's try the caves. No problem, right? The first one was big with a lake entry and had several big openings to the sink holes above . Was a great entry level cave. \r\nYou'll notice the cameraman moving the camera up and down and there is blurring in the water. This is where the fresh water meets the salt water and there is a chemical reaction going on that causes the blurring. He also shows the bottom which is an old sea bed that has coral in it. plus Mayan pottery pieces. \r\nThe second cave was not an easy one. The entry was through a puddle in front of a cliff that had water running down it, Not enough to call a waterfall but enough to maintain the puddle. You laid down in the puddle and slid in through a crack in the cliff under water to enter the cave system. The weird lights Shining at an angle through water is from small sink hole in the jungle floor above. We swim 300 yards into this system to a sinkhole which opens to the jungle but which you cannot exit . At one point we had to take our tanks off and pass them through a small hole to continue on into the caves. Hope you find this enjoyable. I have several more in this series and will post them under 'The voyages of Dascubadude'\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\nComplete name                            : Cave DivingDVD Video Recording_Title2.mp4\r\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\r\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\r\nCodec ID                                 : isom\r\nFile size                                : 360 MiB\r\nDuration                                 : 35mn 38s\r\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Variable\r\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 411 Kbps\r\nMovie name                               : DVD_Video_Recording\r\nWriting application                      : Lavf54.6.100\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nID                                       : 1\r\nFormat                                   : AVC\r\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\r\nFormat profile                           :   \r\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : No\r\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 6 frames\r\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\r\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\r\nDuration                                 : 35mn 38s\r\nBit rate                                 : 1 276 Kbps\r\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\r\nHeight                                   : 540 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 4:3\r\nFrame rate mode                          : Constant\r\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\r\nColor space                              : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\r\nScan type                                : Progressive\r\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.110\r\nStream size                              : 325 MiB (90%)\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nID                                       : 2\r\nFormat                                   : AAC\r\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\r\nFormat profile                           : LC\r\nCodec ID                                 : 40\r\nDuration                                 : 35mn 38s\r\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\r\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\r\nMaximum bit rate                         : 132 Kbps\r\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\r\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\r\nStream size                              : 32.7 MiB (9%)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cd534e8edf014f37453e419ee9a510d2377df86","amp;dn":"Cave+Diving+Yucatan%281996%29MPEG-4%5BVoyages+of+DaScubaDude%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cd534e8edf014f37453e419ee9a510d2377df86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,213,52,232,237,240,20,243,116,83,228,25,238,154,81,13,35,119,223,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
