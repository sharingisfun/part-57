They had been best friends since they were six, spending hot Minneapolis summers and cold Minneapolis winters together, dreaming of Hogwarts and Oz, superheroes and baseball. Now that they were eleven, it was weird for a boy and a girl to be best friends. But they couldnâ€™t help it â€“ Hazel and Jack fit, in that way you only read about in books. And they didnâ€™t fit anywhere else.\r\nAnd then, one day, it was over. Jack just stopped talking to Hazel. And while her mom tried to tell her that this sometimes happens to boys and girls at this age, Hazel had read enough stories to know that itâ€™s never that simple. And it turns out, she was right. Jackâ€™s heart had been frozen, and he was taken into the woods by a woman dressed in white to live in a palace made of ice. Now, itâ€™s up to Hazel to venture into the woods after him. Hazel finds, however, that these woods are nothing like what sheâ€™s read about, and the Jack that Hazel went in to save isnâ€™t the same Jack that will emerge. Or even the same Hazel","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ca5aa5c9655e28bbe509d313ea46ac38dc39e86","amp;dn":"Jasmine+Richards%3A+The+Book+of+Wonders","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ca5aa5c9655e28bbe509d313ea46ac38dc39e86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,165,170,92,150,85,226,139,190,80,157,49,62,164,106,195,141,195,158,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
