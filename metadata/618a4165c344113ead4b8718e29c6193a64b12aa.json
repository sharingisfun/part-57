But just as amazing as her recipes is her ability to explain how any one of us can make these delicious breads and desserts ourselves. Valerie is a genius baker. She is equally a genius teacher.\r\nValerie and her husband grow the soft-grain wheat she uses in her baking on the 6Â½-acre homestead where theyâ€™ve raised their five children. She grinds the wheat by hand when sheâ€™s ready to use it. She began inviting friends into her own kitchen when they kept begging her to show them how she turned out such featherweight dinner rolls, tender pizza crusts, and tangy-sweet crisps and cobblersâ€”always using whole grains.\r\nBaking with Whole Grains includes more than 110 recipes and full-color photos of Valerie in her wheat field, grinding grain, and baking in her home kitchen, as well as photos of her irresistible breads and sweets.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nValerie Baer and her husband grow and produce on their own land approximately two-thirds of the food they eat. When Valerie began working with freshly ground flour, she soon realized its superior flavor. She soon got her own manual grain grinder so she could always bake with the freshest flour possible. Valerie and her husband Jim live near Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nIntroduction\r\nAbout the Grains Used in This Book\r\nBasic Equipment Makes Cooking Fun\r\nIngredient Specifications\r\nCakes\r\nCobblers and Crisps\r\nCookies and Bars\r\nCrackers, Dips, and Spreads\r\nMuffins\r\nPancakes and Waffles\r\nPies\r\nQuick Breads\r\nScones\r\nYeast Breads\r\nHow to Make the Best of Scraps, Failures, and Tired Baked Goods\r\nIndex of Tips\r\nIndex of Recipes\r\nAbout the Author\r\n \nhttp://s11.postimg.org/dmpuxz70z/Baking_with_Whole_Grains.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:618a4165c344113ead4b8718e29c6193a64b12aa","amp;dn":"Baking+with+Whole+Grains+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"618a4165c344113ead4b8718e29c6193a64b12aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,138,65,101,195,68,17,62,173,75,135,24,226,156,97,147,166,75,18,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
