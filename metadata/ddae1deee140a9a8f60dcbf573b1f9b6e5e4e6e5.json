Remember her?  She was the prim, proper reporter on the 1950s Superman TV show.  Will be interesting to see her as Jungle Girl.  This one is 12 episodes of glorious Black and White from 1955.\r\n\r\nJean Evans of an international wildlife foundation has made herself at home in Africa as the elephant-riding, vine-swinging, miniskirted 'Panther Girl.' On safari to film animals, Jean encounters something really wild; a giant crayfish monster (created by greedy scientist Morgan who, with his henchmen, hopes to scare everyone out of the district, then secretly mine diamonds). Jungle perils aplenty stand between Jean (an active, competent heroine) and her hunter friend Larry and their goal of tracing the 'claw monster' to its source.
