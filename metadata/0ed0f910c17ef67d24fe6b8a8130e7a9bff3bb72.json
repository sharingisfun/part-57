I just wanted to download a fresh copy of Win7 AIO to repair a machine. I couldn't find one and almost installed an infected version on a business machine.\r\n\r\nGrabbed this copy of Win7 SP1 off an old disk I had from yesteryear (around 2010-2011) and uploaded it after compressing with 7zip. \r\n\r\nNot activated. Fresh copy. Just use 7zip to get the ISO back out of the archive.\r\n\r\nCompression knocked about 1GB off the file.\r\n\r\nEverything from Win7 basic to Ultimate, both 32 and 64 bit.\r\n\r\nHave fun and make sure not to download infected versions of the OS.\r\n\r\nP.S. Microsoft is a bag of dicks with telemetry and Windows 10. All spying shit.\r\n\r\nExamples are winstore.mobile.exe, WPN sneakily through explorer.exe, and so so many more background services devoted to sending everything you do and your private data and communications regarding advertising and telemetry.\r\n\r\nWhen you get windows updates make sure to delete the diagnostics tracking service and install Spybot Anti-Beacon for starters.\r\n\r\nDamn Micro$haft","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ed0f910c17ef67d24fe6b8a8130e7a9bff3bb72","amp;dn":"Windows+7+SP1+All-in-one+%28AIO%29+EN+RUS+x64+x86+Unactivated+Fresh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ed0f910c17ef67d24fe6b8a8130e7a9bff3bb72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,208,249,16,193,126,246,125,36,254,107,138,129,48,231,169,191,243,187,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
