Or, thoroughly verify every file with byte-by-byte comparisons. FTP sites, cloud storage, and zip files are integrated seamlessly, and powerful filters allow you to limit what you see to only what you're interested in.\r\n\r\nOnce you've found specific files you're interested in, Beyond Compare can intelligently pick the best way to compare and display them. \r\nText files can be viewed and edited with syntax highlighting and comparison rules tweaked specifically for documents, source code, and HTML. \r\nThe text contents of Microsoft Word .doc and Adobe .pdf files can also be compared but not edited. \r\nData files, executables, binary data, and images all have dedicated viewers as well, so you always have a clear view of the changes.\r\n\r\n3-way Merge (Pro edition only)\r\n\r\nBeyond Compare's merge view allows you to combine changes from two versions of a file or folder into a single output. \r\nIts intelligent approach allows you to quickly accept most changes while carefully examining conflicts. \r\nColor coding and section highlighting allow you to accept, reject, or combine changes, simply and easily.\r\nWhen merging files you can change any line in the output with the built-in syntax-highlighting editor.\r\nBy using Beyond Compare's powerful file type support and ability to favor changes from one file, you can trivially accept many changes without even seeing them.\r\n\r\nYou can use Beyond Compare directly from most version control systems, giving you all of the powerful comparing and merging support you need when you need it most. Integrated source control commands are also available, allowing you to check in and check out files without interrupting your work.\r\n\r\nSynchronize Folders\r\n\r\nBeyond Compare's intuitive Folder Sync interface lets you reconcile differences in your data automatically.\r\nYou can efficiently update your laptop, backup your computer, or manage your website, and Beyond Compare will handle all the details.\r\nYou can copy to and from disks, FTP servers, and zip files, all using the same interface.\r\nAnything you don't want affected can be easily filtered out, and all of the powerful comparison techniques are available, making the backup as fast or robust as you need.\r\n\r\nYou can automate repetitive tasks using a flexible scripting language, and any script can be called from the command line, allowing you to schedule your syncs for when it's most convenient.\r\n\r\nHomepage http://www.scootersoftware.com/index.php","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e64e78078e2f3491500fb458bc5e15ce629cc883","amp;dn":"Beyond+Compare+Pro+4.1.3+build+20814+%28Install+%2B+Portable%29+-+ZWT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e64e78078e2f3491500fb458bc5e15ce629cc883","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,78,120,7,142,47,52,145,80,15,180,88,188,94,21,206,98,156,200,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
