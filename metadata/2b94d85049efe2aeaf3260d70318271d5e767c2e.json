Against Kapita's advice, Secretary General Gabrielle Tackichieff decides to keep the president's health issues secret from the media, despite the fact that he is in hospital. However, her plan goes awry when a group of people are taken hostage by terrorists on an industrial site in Algeria run by a French company. Reluctantly, the president agrees to allow Bakian, a somewhat shady intermediary, to negotiate with the terrorists on the French government's behalf. Meanwhile, Juliette still hasn't returned home and Kapita is growing increasingly worried. \r\n\r\nVideo 852 x 420 / 25 fps / 1037 kbps / Mp4\r\n\r\nAudio 128 kbps AAC\r\n\r\nDuration 0:47\r\n\r\nSeed to the Max - Merci beaucoup . . .\r\n\r\nSno","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b94d85049efe2aeaf3260d70318271d5e767c2e","amp;dn":"Spin+S02+E03+-+Hardcoded+Eng+Subs+-+Sno","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b94d85049efe2aeaf3260d70318271d5e767c2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,148,216,80,73,239,226,174,175,50,96,215,3,24,39,29,94,118,124,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
