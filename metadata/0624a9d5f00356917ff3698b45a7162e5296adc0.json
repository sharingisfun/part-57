Interestingly, both of these experiments are run by a subgroup of scientists from the Max Planck Institute. Max Planck was a German theoretical physicist who won the Nobel prize in Physics in 1918 for his work on the quantum theory. Since his death a research institute has been opened in his name. During the Third Reich the group originally named the Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science, participated in Nazi scientific operations. When World War II ended, the Max Planck Society took over, forming itâ€™s own experiments. Today, these wide spread experiments all seem to center around the re-creation of a supercomputer that has the same connections as a human brain","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0624a9d5f00356917ff3698b45a7162e5296adc0","amp;dn":"Freedom+Fighter+Times+-+CERN%3A+Praising+the+Beast","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0624a9d5f00356917ff3698b45a7162e5296adc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,36,169,213,240,3,86,145,127,243,105,139,69,167,22,46,82,150,173,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
