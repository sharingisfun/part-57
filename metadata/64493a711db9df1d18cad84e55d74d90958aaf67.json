Grohl joined Lynne on â€œHey Bulldogâ€ and Walsh and Gary Clark Jr. on â€œWhile My Guitar Gently Weepsâ€; Walsh, Lynne and George Harrisonâ€˜s son Dhani covered â€œSomethingâ€; Imagine Dragons delivered an acoustic rendition of â€œRevolutionâ€; and Eurythmics performed â€œThe Fool on the Hill.â€\r\n\r\nA few of the performances were spliced with footage of The Beatles. For example, a clip of The Beatles playing â€œAll My Lovingâ€ transitioned into Maroon 5â€˜s rendition of the song. \r\n\r\nOnly a handful of the performers shared their personal memories of The Beatles. One of them, Dave Grohl, discussed how the band was a favorite of his mother, himself and his young daughter.\r\n\r\nThe show was capped by performances by Ringo Starr, who sang three tunes, including â€œYellow Submarine,â€ and Paul McCartney, whose set was a bit longer.\r\n\r\nPaul confessed that he was initially hesitant to take part in the event. He said, â€œI was wondering if it was the right thing to do, if it was seemly to tribute yourself. But I saw a couple of American guys who said to me, you donâ€™t understand the impact of that Ed Sullivan Show on America.â€\r\n\r\nPaul performed a string of Beatles hits, including â€œI Saw Her Standing Thereâ€ and â€œSgt. Pepperâ€™s Lonely Hearts Club Band.â€ Ringo returned to provide vocals for â€œWith a Little Help from My Friendsâ€ before he sat at the drum kit for a sing-along version of â€œHey Judeâ€ that saw Paul on the piano and all of the guest artists on stage.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, only two of the five songs from The Beatlesâ€™ performance on The Ed Sullivan Show on February 9, 1964 were heard on the show.\r\n\r\nThe special also featured an interview with Paul and Ringo conducted by David Letterman at the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York, the site of The Beatlesâ€™ Ed Sullivan Show appearance, where Letterman now tapes his Late Show. There were also short biographies on each Beatle, including John Lennon and George Harrison.\r\n\r\nThe Beatles: The Night that Changed America â€” A Grammy Salute was hosted by LL Cool J. Johnny Depp, Kate Beckinsale, Anna Kendrick, Jeff Bridges, Tom Hanks and Eric Idle were among the many A-list actors in attendance.\r\n\r\nAlso watching from the seats: John Lennonâ€™s widow, Yoko Ono; their son, Sean Lennon; and George Harrisonâ€™s widow, Olivia Harrison.\r\n\r\nHere are the performances that aired on the special, in chronological order:\r\n\r\nMaroon 5\r\nâ€œAll My Lovingâ€\r\nâ€œTicket to Rideâ€\r\n\r\nStevie Wonder\r\nâ€œWe Can Work It Outâ€\r\n\r\nJoe Walsh, Jeff Lynne and Dhani Harrison\r\nâ€œSomethingâ€\r\n\r\nEd Sheeran\r\nâ€œIn My Lifeâ€\r\n\r\nKeith Urban and John Mayer\r\nâ€œDonâ€™t Let Me Downâ€\r\n\r\nKaty Perry\r\nâ€œYesterdayâ€\r\n\r\nImagine Dragons\r\nâ€œRevolutionâ€ (acoustic)\r\n\r\nDave Grohl and Jeff Lynne\r\nâ€œHey Bulldogâ€\r\n\r\nEurythmics\r\nâ€œThe Fool on the Hillâ€\r\n\r\nAlicia Keys and John Legend\r\nâ€œLet It Beâ€\r\n\r\nPharrell Williams, Brad Paisley and Cirque du Soleil\r\nâ€œHere Comes the Sunâ€\r\n\r\nGary Clark Jr., Joe Walsh and Dave Grohl\r\nâ€œWhile My Guitar Gently Weepsâ€\r\n\r\nRingo Starr\r\nâ€œMatchboxâ€\r\nâ€œBoysâ€\r\nâ€œYellow Submarineâ€\r\n\r\nPaul McCartney\r\nâ€œBirthdayâ€\r\nâ€œGet Backâ€\r\nâ€œI Saw Her Standing Thereâ€\r\nâ€œSgt.
