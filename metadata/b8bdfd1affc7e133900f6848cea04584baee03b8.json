Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the crew of the Starfleet starship Enterprise-D.\r\n\r\nThis season sees Picard have some of the more memorable experiences of the series, such as learning to communicate with the heretofore unintelligible Tamarians (&quot;Darmok&quot;), overcoming his dislike of children when he is trapped along with three children after the Enterprise-D is struck by a quantum filament (&quot;Disaster&quot;), and meeting with Ambassador Spock on Romulus in &quot;Unification&quot;. Most notably, in &quot;The Inner Light&quot;, he experiences 40 or so years of life as an ironweaver on an extinct alien world after an encounter with a probe launched before the destruction of that world.\r\n\r\nWesley also makes a few appearances in this season when he saves the Enterprise from an alien game which was actually a mind-control device (&quot;The Game&quot;), and later at Starfleet Academy when he participates in a coverup of the circumstances surrounding the death of one of his classmates (&quot;The First Duty&quot;).\r\n\r\nThe season ends with the discovery of Data's head in a cave under San Francisco which had been sealed for 500 years, and eventually with Data, Picard, La Forge, Troi, Riker, and Doctor Crusher trapped in 19th century Earth (&quot;Time's Arrow&quot;).\r\n\r\n\r\n101 \t1 \t&quot;Redemption II&quot; \t\r\n102 \t2 \t&quot;Darmok&quot; \t\r\n103 \t3 \t&quot;Ensign Ro&quot; \t\r\n104 \t4 \t&quot;Silicon Avatar&quot; \t\r\n105 \t5 \t&quot;Disaster&quot; \t\r\n106 \t6 \t&quot;The Game&quot; \t\r\n107 \t7 \t&quot;Unification I&quot; \t\r\n108 \t8 \t&quot;Unification II&quot; \t\r\n109 \t9 \t&quot;A Matter of Time&quot; \t\r\n110 \t10 \t&quot;New Ground&quot; \t\r\n111 \t11 \t&quot;Hero Worship&quot; \t\r\n112 \t12 \t&quot;Violations&quot; \t\r\n113 \t13 \t&quot;The Masterpiece Society&quot; \t\r\n114 \t14 \t&quot;Conundrum&quot; \t\r\n115 \t15 \t&quot;Power Play&quot; \t\r\n116 \t16 \t&quot;Ethics&quot; \t\r\n117 \t17 \t&quot;The Outcast&quot; \t\r\n118 \t18 \t&quot;Cause and Effect&quot; \t\r\n119 \t19 \t&quot;The First Duty&quot; \t\r\n120 \t20 \t&quot;Cost of Living&quot; \t\r\n121 \t21 \t&quot;The Perfect Mate&quot; \t\r\n122 \t22 \t&quot;Imaginary Friend&quot; \t\r\n123 \t23 \t&quot;I, Borg&quot; \t\r\n124 \t24 \t&quot;The Next Phase&quot; \t\r\n125 \t25 \t&quot;The Inner Light&quot; \t\r\n126 \t26 \t&quot;Time's Arrow&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8bdfd1affc7e133900f6848cea04584baee03b8","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+-+The+Next+Generation+-+Season+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8bdfd1affc7e133900f6848cea04584baee03b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,189,253,26,255,199,225,51,144,15,104,72,206,160,69,132,186,238,3,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
