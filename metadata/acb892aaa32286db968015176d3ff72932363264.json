Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the crew of the Starfleet starship Enterprise-D.\n\nThis season saw the show embracing the notion of serialized storylines. A recurring theme throughout the season is the notion of a brewing Duras-Romulan plot against the Federation, coupled with Worf's effort to reclaim his family honor. Both storylines were introduced in Season 3's &quot;Sins of the Father&quot;. Worf's discommendation is a major theme in &quot;Family&quot; and &quot;The Drumhead&quot;, while his dishonor and the Duras-Romulan plot take center stage in the episodes &quot;Reunion&quot;, &quot;The Mind's Eye&quot;, and &quot;Redemption&quot;.\n\nA second recurring storyline in the season is the growth of Miles O'Brien as a character. His first and middle name are revealed in &quot;Family&quot;, he marries in &quot;Data's Day&quot;, his past is revealed in &quot;The Wounded&quot;, and his marriage is explored in &quot;In Theory&quot;.\n\nSeason 4 featured many family-themes episodes. The first episode following &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot; deals with Picard and Worf's family, and the second with Data's. Worf's son Alexander appears later in the season, as does Tasha Yar's sister, and the Enterprise encounters an infant alien space entity.\n\n\n75 \t1 \t&quot;The Best of Both Worlds: Part II&quot; \t\n76 \t2 \t&quot;Family&quot; \t\n77 \t3 \t&quot;Brothers&quot; \t\n78 \t4 \t&quot;Suddenly Human&quot; \t\n79 \t5 \t&quot;Remember Me&quot; \t\n80 \t6 \t&quot;Legacy&quot; \t\n81 \t7 \t&quot;Reunion&quot; \t\n82 \t8 \t&quot;Future Imperfect&quot; \t\n83 \t9 \t&quot;Final Mission&quot; \t\n84 \t10 \t&quot;The Loss&quot; \t\n85 \t11 \t&quot;Data's Day&quot; \t\n86 \t12 \t&quot;The Wounded&quot; \t\n87 \t13 \t&quot;Devil's Due&quot; \t\n88 \t14 \t&quot;Clues&quot; \t\n89 \t15 \t&quot;First Contact&quot; \t\n90 \t16 \t&quot;Galaxy's Child&quot; \t\n91 \t17 \t&quot;Night Terrors&quot; \t\n92 \t18 \t&quot;Identity Crisis&quot; \t\n93 \t19 \t&quot;The Nth Degree&quot; \t\n94 \t20 \t&quot;Qpid&quot; \t44741.9 \t\n95 \t21 \t&quot;The Drumhead&quot; \t\n96 \t22 \t&quot;Half a Life&quot; \n97 \t23 \t&quot;The Host&quot; \t\n98 \t24 \t&quot;The Mind's Eye&quot; \t\n99 \t25 \t&quot;In Theory&quot; \t\n100 \t26 \t&quot;Redemption I&quot; \t44995.3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acb892aaa32286db968015176d3ff72932363264","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+-+The+Next+Generation+-+Season+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acb892aaa32286db968015176d3ff72932363264","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,184,146,170,163,34,134,219,150,128,21,23,109,63,247,41,50,54,50,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
