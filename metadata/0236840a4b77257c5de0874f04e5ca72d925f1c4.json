Under the spiritual influence of the 'Singing River', as Native Americans called it, the music of Muscle Shoals has helped create some of the most important and resonant songs of all time.\r\n At its heart is Rick Hall, who founded FAME Studios. Overcoming poverty and tragedy, Hall brought black and white together in Alabama's cauldron of racial hostility to create music for the generations. Greg Allman, Bono, Clarence Carter, Mick Jagger, Etta James, Alicia Keys, Keith Richards, Percy Sledge and others bear witness to Muscle Shoals's magnetism, mystery and why it remains influential today.\r\n\r\n\r\nGSpot Says:\r\nDVD VOB format\r\nMPEG-2Program Stream &lt;&lt; (1 vid, 1 aud)\r\nSys Bitrate 10080 kb/s VBR 4957 kbps I/L TFF\r\nPAL 16:9\r\n\r\nAC3 0xbd(0x80):48000Hz 384 kb/s tot.\r\nstereo (2/0)\r\n\r\n\r\nPlay It LOUD!\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0236840a4b77257c5de0874f04e5ca72d925f1c4","amp;dn":"Storyville-MuscleShoals-BBCTV-2014-DVD5-PAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0236840a4b77257c5de0874f04e5ca72d925f1c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,54,132,10,75,119,37,124,93,224,135,79,4,229,202,114,217,37,241,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
