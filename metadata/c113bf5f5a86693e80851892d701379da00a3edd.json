It's the same as the original show, but without the majorly crude jokes. Some very minor crude jokes still remain, like &quot;I'll take your thoughts and digest them, and see what comes out the other end&quot; or &quot;my future's not gonna be determined by 7 little white lotto balls. It's gonna be determined by two big black balls&quot;. Basically any crude jokes that are relating to sex are removed, but I had it done in a way where you can't usually tell that anything was even removed , and the story line is still kept intact. Still has some minor language, but there were a few parts I took out that had an unusual amount of language that had nothing to do with the story.\r\n\r\nWARNING!\r\nEpisode 2 (Originally named Sexual Harassment) had a very unusual amount of dirty jokes, so it was very tricky to remove them without affecting the story line of the episode. There may be some very minor sexual references, but nothing too out of line. You might be better off skipping this episode, as it doesn't play a very big part on the story of the show. Although it does introduce Todd Packers character, and Pam's mom, and Michael talking about who Toby is and what he thinks of him.\r\n\r\nEpisodes in this season:\r\n\r\n1. The Dundies\r\n2.
