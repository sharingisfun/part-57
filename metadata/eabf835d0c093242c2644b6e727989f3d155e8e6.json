Windows break. Books rocket across the room. Lights flicker. Strange occurrences follow the sixteen-year-old everywhere. Sheâ€™s an outcast at her school, but everything changes in the blink of an eye.\r\nWhen tragedy forces her to move to the small town of Clearwater, Michigan, with her estranged aunt Jodi, Kristyl tries to leave her past behind. She makes friends and catches the attention of Owen Marsh, who accepts her without question and who may be able to understand her better than anyone.\r\nBut Owen isnâ€™t the only one who notices her. The mysteriously alluring Fox Holloway draws Kristylâ€™s eye whenever heâ€™s around. And Clearwater Highâ€™s chief mean-girl, Crystal Jamison, has her sights set on Kristyl and will stop at nothing to prove what Kristyl really is.\r\nA witch.\r\nMagic can be as dangerous as fire, and Aunt Jodi wants Kristyl to have nothing to do with it. But when a mysterious illness threatens her auntâ€™s life, Kristyl will do anything to cure her. Enlisting the help of witches could save Jodi, but is dealing in magic worth the consequences?\r\n \r\n..[/color][/center]\r\n\r\n\r\n[center][img]http://s10.postimg.org/l1kh8y3gp/cooltext1925887515.gif[/img][/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eabf835d0c093242c2644b6e727989f3d155e8e6","amp;dn":"Crystal+Magic+%28Book1%29+By+Madeline+Freeman+%5BEpub%5D+%5BDTW%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eabf835d0c093242c2644b6e727989f3d155e8e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,191,131,93,12,9,50,66,194,100,75,110,114,121,137,243,209,85,232,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
