Demons are the disembodied Spirits of The Nephilim. They want to enter your Body, but they must have your permission.\r\n\r\n WATCHERS NINE, DAYS OF CHAOS attempts to pull together a team of experts to try and answer some of the most disturbing questions about the times in which we live. Host/Author L.A. Marzulli covers many topics of interest: Dr. Brooks Agnew tells us about EMPs and Jade HELM. We investigate the bee die-off, the 7 year drought in California, violence increasing, Director Richard Shaw found aliens in the Kumburgaz UFO footage and shows how he did it, a pastor in Iran tells us that Yeshua is visiting\r\n\r\n\r\nBook - Days of Chaos\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of looking at the events happening in the world around us. The first is that all of these events are just natural phenomena. With this in mind one would look at Israel coming into her ancient homeland after almost 2,000 years of diaspora and would not see any relevance, nor would it matter. To put it bluntly, in this way of thinking one would embrace the world view that there is no god, no prophecy, and no supernatural world. There is only what we can see, hear, taste, smell and observe using the scientific method. Then there is the other world view that embraces The Holy Bible or The Guidebook to the Supernatural that takes the opposite stance on all of these positions. There is a God and He is good. There is a supernatural world and it is manifesting. There are signs that those who have eyes to see and ears to hear can point to and say that His comingâ€”the Second Coming of Jesusâ€”is soon. There is going to be a profound change in human history, and it begins upon His return.\r\n\r\nThe skeptic asks, where is the promise of His coming for all things continue as before? In my way of thinking based on my worldview, we are seeing the birth pains that Jesus warned us would appear before His return. It would seem that prophetic events are accelerating, as I believe we are seeing the signs that warn us of what is coming on the earth... These are the Days of Chaos.\r\nPreface End Times? â€“ The World View I Embrace\r\n\r\nPosted by lamarzulli on April 16, 2010\r\nI want to talk about my worldview. Itâ€™s based on the prophecies found in The Guidebook to the Supernatural, i.e. the Bible. It is also based on my experience as being a born again and Spirit-filled man for 30 years. We are living in unprec- edented times. It would appear that there are signs all around us. What I mean by this is that we are told that there will be signs that indicate we are living in the last days. One of the most dramatic is the return of Israel to its ancient homeland. There are those who believe that somehow Israel was the work of the Illuminati. I couldnâ€™t disagree more. A careful study of how Israel became a nation negates this position totally. Without getting long-winded about this, here are some facts.\r\n\r\nHitler almost succeeded in wiping out every Jew from the planet. An exodus followed after the war ended, and European Jews migrated to what was then Palestine. The British, who controlled Palestine, left and the Jews fought for the right to have a nation. Against all odds they won the war, and shortly afterwards, the state of Israel was voted in as a nation, only passing by one vote in the United Nations. If we take the position that Israel has no relevance in prophecy, then we will never be able to understand what is happening on this planet in regard to a Biblical worldview","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3648090ca9e89db99891afe329e762bdf93bd246","amp;dn":"Hidden+Secrets+-+Part+105+-+The+Watchers+9++-+LA+Marzulli","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3648090ca9e89db99891afe329e762bdf93bd246","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,72,9,12,169,232,157,185,152,145,175,227,41,231,98,189,249,59,210,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
