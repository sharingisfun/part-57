The Media Accepts Blame. James Taranto, WSJ Editorial. Joshua Green, Bloomberg Politics.\r\n\r\nâ€œâ€¦The president didnâ€™t mention Trump by name, but the implication was clear enough when he bemoaned â€œthe divisive and often vulgar rhetoric thatâ€™s aimed at everybody, but often is focused on the vulnerable or women or minorities.â€ The Timesâ€™s Mark Landler took the lecture as a campaign speech on behalf of the inevitable Democratic nomineeâ€”that is, as a rebuke to her primary challenger as well as her likeliest general-election opponent:\r\n\r\nâ€œThe president suggested that the news media had not done enough to question the promises made by politiciansâ€”an apparent reference not only to Mr. Trump, but also to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the independent who is challenging Hillary Clinton, Mr. Obamaâ€™s former secretary of state, for the Democratic nomination. Mr. Sanders has promised free public college education and national health care coverage, ambitious social programs that critics say could never be enacted.\r\n\r\nHereâ€™s the full passage from the presidentâ€™s lecture:\r\n\r\nâ€œA job well done is about more than just handing someone a microphone. It is to probe and to question, and to dig deeper, and to demand more. The electorate would be better served if that happened. It would be better served if billions of dollars in free media came with serious accountability, especially when politicians issue unworkable plans or make promises they canâ€™t keep. And there are reporters here who know they canâ€™t keep them. I know thatâ€™s a shocking concept that politicians would do that. But without a press that asks tough questions, voters take them at their word. When people put their faith in someone who canâ€™t possibly deliver on his or her promises, that only breeds more cynicismâ€¦.â€\r\n \nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/commentator-in-chief-1459269775?tesla=y","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80382cce0e546953bc430c30e8e35c08ef9b7bb5","amp;dn":"johnbatchelor-obama-blames-media-trump.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80382cce0e546953bc430c30e8e35c08ef9b7bb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,56,44,206,14,84,105,83,188,67,12,48,232,227,92,8,239,155,123,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
