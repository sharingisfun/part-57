Mulligan and Baker had very few reunions after 1953 but this particular CD from 1957 is an exception. \r\nAlthough not quite possessing the magic of the earlier group, the music is quite enjoyable and the interplay between the two horns is still special. With expert backup by bassist Henry Grimes and drummer Dave Bailey, these 13 selections (plus two new alternate takes) should please fans of both Mulligan and Baker.
