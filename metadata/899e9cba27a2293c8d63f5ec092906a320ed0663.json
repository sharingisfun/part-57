Eye Candy will get you there.\r\n\r\nEye Candy 7 renders realistic effects that are difficult or impossible to achieve in Photoshop alone, such as Fire, Chrome, and the new Lightning. Effects like Animal Fur, Smoke, and Reptile Skin are rendered in exquisite detail down to individual hairs, turbulent wisps, and shiny scales.\r\n\r\nEye Candy helps you quickly explore and design looks. In Eye Candy 7, effects are chosen through easy to recognize icons rather than text menus. Presets are rapidly previewed by simply mousing over them. The theme is less clicking and more visual browsing.\r\n\r\nWhatâ€™s New\r\n\r\nEven Easier\r\nWe completely rewrote the Eye Candy user interface to make it easier to explore. The theme is less clicking and more visual browsing. Eye Candy 7 is now a single entry in Photoshopâ€™s filter menu. That means that you can explore all of our effects without leaving the Eye Candy window. Instead of choosing an effect category by reading a text list, youâ€™ll see icons that show typical uses of each effect. Click the image below to see the full size as it appears in Eye Candy 7.\r\n\r\nIn the preference panel you can choose how the effect is rendered in a new layer. If you prefer the Eye Candy 5 approach, you can have the new layer include just the effect and not a copy of your original artwork.\r\n\r\nMany Eye Candy effects use transparency, so we moved the transparency display control out of the preference panel and put it under the main preview. This lets you quickly switch the background between checkerboard, black, white, or a custom solid color.\r\n\r\nOnce you choose an effect, you can explore presets fast using the navigator, which is a small preview that instantly updates. You donâ€™t even have to click. Just mouse over preset names and the navigator shows how the effect will look in your design. In the screenshot below you can see the navigator in the lower left. Click the image to see more detail.\r\n\r\nNew Effects\r\nBy popular demand, we rescued the best effects from our discontinued Xenofex product: Lightning, Electrify (seen above), and Clouds. We rewrote them for our new Eye Candy 7 framework, which provides faster previewing, better preset management, and easier experimentation.\r\n\r\nEye Candy has grown over 19 years to handle a huge range of graphic design tasks, from subtle extruded edges to glitzy chrome. There are 32 effect categories, over 1000 presets, and controls to let you create an unlimited number of your own styles. \r\n\r\nHomepage http://www.alienskin.com/eyecandy/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:899e9cba27a2293c8d63f5ec092906a320ed0663","amp;dn":"Alien+Skin+Eye+Candy+7.1.0.1203+%2864-bit%29+%2B+Patch+MPT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"899e9cba27a2293c8d63f5ec092906a320ed0663","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,158,156,186,39,162,41,60,141,99,245,236,9,41,6,163,32,237,6,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
