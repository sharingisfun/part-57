It is the opening track and lead single from the band's second album, Nevermind (1991), released on DGC Records. Written by Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic, and Dave Grohl and produced by Butch Vig, the song uses a verse-chorus form where the main four-chord riff is used during the intro and chorus to create an alternating loud and quiet dynamic. The sound of the song (as Cobain admitted) is modeled after the sound of the Pixies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0bf07a10feba62fd95f9b344bccf20640522634","amp;dn":"Nirvana+-+Smells+Like+Teen+Spirit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0bf07a10feba62fd95f9b344bccf20640522634","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,191,7,161,15,235,166,47,217,95,155,52,75,204,242,6,64,82,38,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
