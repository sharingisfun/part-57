It replaces over 600 textures and normal maps\r\nall over the world of Skyrim and accumulated man-hours that go well into four-digit figures.\r\n\r\n\r\nPackages:\r\n\r\nCOMPLETE EDITION:\r\n- FULL\r\n- LITE\r\n\r\nCUSTOM EDITION (FULL/LITE):\r\n- Cities: This covers all the cities; Whiterun, Windhelm, Markarth, Solitude, Riften, Farmhouses and those of the Dragonborn DLC.\r\n- Landscape: This covers all landscape textures.\r\n- Dungeons: This covers all the dungeon textures (basic dungeon ground and dwemer ruins).r\r\n- Misc: This covers the rest: reflections, water, sky, clutter, clothes, etc. \r\n\r\n(The Dragonborn textures are included in each package, but don't necessarily need the DLC to be installed)\r\n\r\nExplanation FULL/LITE:\r\nFULL - All the textures are at the maximum resolution. Average is around 4x the official HD DLC.\r\nLITE - All the textures are at 50% of the FULL Version. Average is around 2x the official HD DLC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is covered?\r\n\r\nLandscape (all textures)\r\n\r\nArchitecture\r\n- Whiterun\r\n- Windhelm\r\n- Farmhouses\r\n- Solitude\r\n- Markarth\r\n- Riften\r\n\r\nSky\r\n- Stars\r\n- Galaxy\r\n- Sunglare\r\n\r\nWater\r\n- Water surface\r\n- Rain Ripples\r\n- Water fog\r\n- Water streams\r\n\r\nClothes\r\n- Barkeeper\r\n- Blacksmith\r\n\r\nClutter\r\n- Sellingbar\r\n- Blacksmith Items\r\n- Carts\r\n- Dresser\r\n- Firewood/Ash/Burned wood\r\n- Stockades\r\n- Alchemy workbench\r\n- Enchanting workbench\r\n- Barrels\r\n- Furniturewood\r\n\r\nDungeons\r\n- Baisc Ground Texture\r\n- Dwemer Ruins\r\n\r\nMisc\r\n- Reflections\r\n- LOD Textures\r\n- Fixes texture Bugs from Beth's HD DLC\r\n\r\nDragonborn DLC\r\n\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements:\r\n\r\nFULL version:\r\n- 4GB RAM\r\n- 2GB VRAM\r\n\r\nLITE version:\r\nIf unmodded Skyrim runs smooth, LITE shouldn't have an effect on performance.\r\nKeep in mind that the FULL version can increase loading times. If you have an SSD,\r\nthis shouldn't be a problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n\r\nPlease use Nexus Mod Manager for ease of installation.\r\n\r\nJust download one of the 'COMPLETE' packages using the 'download with manager' button.\r\nIf you want to customize your install, you can use the packages (cities, landscape, etc.) instead.\r\nMixing of LITE and FULL packages is possible. The installation order doesn't matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n\r\nVersion 1.7\r\n- Added textures for the Dragonborn DLC\r\n- Fixes on many old textures \r\n(By popular demand: Old textures were optimized/fixed/..., not remade.
