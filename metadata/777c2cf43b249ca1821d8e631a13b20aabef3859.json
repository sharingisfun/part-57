However, five years later and with two children, the truth is that Grace is dissatisfied with life in the palace and her husband's aloofness. The chance to again feel useful arises when his old friend, the director Alfred Hitchcock (Roger Ashton-Griffiths), invites her to return to the film as the protagonist of his next film, &quot;Marnie - Confessions of a Thief.&quot; The problem is that Rainier is adamantly opposed and, moreover, is involved with a threat from French President Charles de Gaule (AndrÃ© Penvern): if Monaco do not pay taxes to France and end the existing tax haven, the principality will be invaded in six months. Amid the inevitable tensions, Grace and Rainier seek to solve their problems trying to prevent them from causing the divorce.\r\n\r\nOriginal title: Grace of Monaco\r\nTitle in Brazil: Grace of Monaco\r\nGenre: Drama\r\nDirector: Olivier Dahan\r\nDuration: 1 hour and 06 minutes\r\nProduction year: 2014\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2095649/\r\n\r\nSize: 1.96 Gb\r\nExtension Archive: .MKV\r\nVideo Quality: BRRip\r\nVideo codec: H.264\r\nAudio codec: AC3 5.1\r\nResolution: 1920 x 800\r\nAudio: Portuguese / English\r\nSubtitles: Portuguese\r\n\r\ni.share.pho.to/848b976e_o.png\r\n\r\n\r\nSEED PLEASE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:777c2cf43b249ca1821d8e631a13b20aabef3859","amp;dn":"Grace+of+Monaco+2014+1080p+BRRip+x264+DUAL+kildare123","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"777c2cf43b249ca1821d8e631a13b20aabef3859","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,124,44,244,59,36,156,161,130,29,142,99,26,19,178,10,171,239,56,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
