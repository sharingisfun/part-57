Mrs. Robinson, the neglected wife of his father's law partner\r\ninsists that he drive her home. Benjamin is coerced inside to have a drink and\r\nMrs. Robinson attempts to seduce him. She invites him up to her daughter Elaine's room\r\nto see her portrait and then enters the room naked, making it clear that she is available\r\nto him.
