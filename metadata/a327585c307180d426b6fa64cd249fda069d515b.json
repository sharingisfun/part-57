In the 1950s, Baker was one of the most famous trumpeters in the world, renowned as both a pioneer of the West Coast jazz scene and an icon of cool. By the 1960s, he was all but washed up, his career and personal life in shambles due to years of heroin addiction. In his innovative anti-biopic, director Robert Budreau zeroes in on Bakerâ€™s life at a key moment in the 1960s, just as the musician attempts to stage a hard-fought comeback, spurred in part by a passionate romance with a new flame (Carmen Ejogo). Creatively blending fact with fiction and driven by Hawkeâ€™s virtuoso performance, Born to Be Blue unfolds with all the stylistic brio and improvisatory genius of great jazz.\r\n\r\nDirector: Robert Budreau\r\n\r\nWriters: Robert Budreau\r\n\r\nActors: Ethan Hawke, Carmen Ejogo, Callum Keith Rennie\r\n\r\nGenre: Drama, Romance\r\n\r\nRun Time: 1 hour 38 minutes\r\n\r\nStudio: Â© 2016 IFC Films","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a327585c307180d426b6fa64cd249fda069d515b","amp;dn":"Born+to+Be+Blue.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%231+%5BHD%5D+%282016%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a327585c307180d426b6fa64cd249fda069d515b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,39,88,92,48,113,128,212,38,182,250,100,205,36,159,218,6,157,81,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
