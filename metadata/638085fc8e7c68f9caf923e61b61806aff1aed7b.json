His ambition puts him at odds with local chieftain Earl Haraldson (Gabriel Byrne), who insists on sending his raiders to the impoverished east rather than the uncharted west. When Ragnar teams up with his boat builder friend Floki (Gustaf Skarsgard) to craft a new generation of intrepid ships capable of conquering the rough northern seas, the stage is set for conflict.\r\n\r\nBut for all its warfare and bloodshed, Vikings is also a story of family and brotherhood, capturing the love and affection between Ragnar and his wife, Lagertha (Katheryn Winnick), a respected warrior in her own right. It is the tale of Ragnarâ€™s brother Rollo (Clive Standen), a fierce fighter who simmers with jealously; of Earl Haraldsonâ€™s wife Siggy (Jessalyn Gilsig), a dutiful beauty who may be less than loyal; and of the monk Athelstan (George Blagden), whose Christian morals clash with the Vikingsâ€™ pagan society. As ambition and innovation rattle a civilization, these characters will be put to the testâ€”and their way of life will never be the same again.\r\n\r\nVikings was created and written by Michael Hirst (Elizabeth, The Tudors).\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\nFormat : Matroska\r\nFormat version : Version 4 / Version 2\r\nOverall bit rate : 1 399 Kbps\r\nWriting application : mkvmerge v6.7.0 ('Back to the Ground') 32bit built on Jan 8 2014 15:03:17\r\nWriting library : libebml v1.3.0 + libmatroska v1.4.1\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nID : 1\r\nFormat : AVC\r\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\r\nFormat profile :   \r\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\r\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 9 frames\r\nCodec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\r\nBit rate : 1 010 Kbps\r\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\r\nHeight : 720 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode : Constant\r\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\r\nColor space : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth : 8 bits\r\nScan type : Progressive\r\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.046\r\nWriting library : x264 core 142 r2409kMod d6b4e63\r\nDefault : Yes\r\nForced : No\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nID : 2\r\nFormat : AC-3\r\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\r\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\r\nFormat settings, Endianness : Big\r\nCodec ID : A_AC3\r\nBit rate mode : Constant\r\nBit rate : 384 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nBit depth : 16 bits\r\nCompression mode : Lossy\r\nDefault : Yes\r\nForced : No","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:638085fc8e7c68f9caf923e61b61806aff1aed7b","amp;dn":"Vikings+Season+2+COMPLETE+720p+HDTV+x264+%5BMKV%2CAC3%2C5.1%5D+Ehhhh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"638085fc8e7c68f9caf923e61b61806aff1aed7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,128,133,252,142,124,104,249,202,249,35,230,27,97,128,106,255,26,237,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
