Home is the 1960s bungalow where Darragh grew up - built on the site of the old village school by his late father Jim and currently occupied by his 70 year old mother, Mary, herself a retired schoolteacher. Architect Dermot Bannon's challenge is to split the house into two private, self-contained wings - one for Mary, the other for Darragh and Sarah. But it's easier said than done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 07-Feb-2016","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e578a903186769d10a0fc0a4da0b88de6e8e2e2","amp;dn":"Room+to+Improve+S09E01+PDTV.x264-TVC.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e578a903186769d10a0fc0a4da0b88de6e8e2e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,87,138,144,49,134,118,157,16,160,252,10,77,160,184,141,230,232,226,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
