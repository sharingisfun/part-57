Young died at 38, leaving a few great Blue Note sessions, work on Miles Davis's Bitches Brew, and some raw fusion with the Tony Williams Lifetime. These newly unearthed 1964-65 recordings recently turned up in broadcaster ORTF's archives, featuring the then Paris-resident's radio shows with American and French musicians, fascinatingly including little-known Stan Getzian sax maestro Jean-Claude Fohrenbach. Trumpeter Woody Shaw's blistering, high-register playing and Nathan Davis's nonchalant tenor-sax ruggedness mingle with a series of breathtaking Young improvisations â€“ twisting and quirky on Trane of Thought, sleek and then petrifyingly fierce on Wayne Shorter's Black Nile, percussively wayward on regular piano on the Monk-like Larry's Blues. The dominant style is earthy, early-Coltraneish hard-bop, and there are long processions of solos â€“ but Young's elegantly reckless improvisations lift this music into another league.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nL Hammond, The Pirate Bay, where you'll find more jazz organ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c427b6027e7f9bad1ccfac4baf0090a1cc900af8","amp;dn":"Larry+Young+-+In+Paris+-+The+ORTF+Recordings","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c427b6027e7f9bad1ccfac4baf0090a1cc900af8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,39,182,2,126,127,155,173,28,207,172,75,175,0,144,161,204,144,10,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
