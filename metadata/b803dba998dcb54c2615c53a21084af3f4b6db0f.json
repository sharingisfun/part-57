I was completely sucked into the worlds of these characters. It takes a master to make me forget I'm holding a book. Well, I forgot that for more than 300 pages.Brilliant.&quot;\r\nâ€” Percival Everett \r\n\r\nâ€œA powerful and fiercely unsentimental novel that blazes past all the well-worn pieties about love and loss and leaves them in ashes.â€\r\nâ€” Jenny Offill\r\n\r\nâ€œYou don't generally read fiction writer Christopher Sorrentino for his plots. You read his novels for the music of his language, the acuteness of his ear for American vernacular, and for the sense that however relaxed his approach to storytelling, he's guiding the reader someplace worth going.... But even in this more story-driven book, Sorrentino finds meaning, melody, grace and more than a little comedy in moments that play out the furthest edges of the plot. It's the texture of what happens between the lines of the story, not the story itself,that sticks in the reader's mind.â€\r\nâ€“ Chicago Tribune's Printer's Row\r\n\r\nâ€œStunningâ€¦.an entirely new kind of novel with exceptional interior monologues animated by deception, double-dealing and a doomed affair that lends an air of existential dread to the story.â€\r\nâ€“ Los Angeles Times\r\n\r\nâ€œBut knowingness is a funny thing in The Fugitives, a novel too cunning, and too interested in how manipulatively autobiographical narratives are deployed,to be read as a simple roman Ã  clef. We all know the How We Live Now novel;this is a How We Lie Now novelâ€¦. Bullshit is the only system Mulligan knows,and itâ€™s a system too entrenched for either him or Kat to escape, let alone find love in. The Fugitives is a novel of that system: It shows us what weâ€™re all stuck inside. â€˜Only in death,â€™ says a ghost, summarily, â€˜is there time to rue life as fully as life deserves.â€™ This brilliantly cranky book suggests that the ghost might be wrong.â€\r\nâ€“ Bookforum\r\n\r\nâ€œSorrentino proved to be a virtuoso of narrative complexity and acid social commentary in Trance(2005), a National Book Award finalist. In this heady tale of self and identity, vocation and ambition, he demonstrates his wily comedic skillsâ€¦.Generating psychological and cultural insights as bright and stinging as a wielderâ€™s sparks, Sorrentino blasts insidious commercialism and corruption, digital narcosis, and the failures of the book and newspaper worlds, while detonating hollow notions of authenticity, ethics, and freedom. A mischievously funny, keenly incisive, and mind-bending outlaw tale.â€\r\nâ€“ Booklist (starred review)\r\n\r\nâ€œHis name evokes Sorrentinoâ€™s fatherâ€™s acclaimed novel Mulligan Stew, another tale of a struggling writer whose narrative falls apart. Mulliganâ€™s novel suffers neglect as he befriends a swindler and becomes involved with an investigative reporter whoâ€™s there to uncover the crime; Sorrentinoâ€™s plot, in contrast, is fine-tuned.â€\r\nâ€“ The Millions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b803dba998dcb54c2615c53a21084af3f4b6db0f","amp;dn":"Christopher+Sorrentino+-+The+Fugitives","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b803dba998dcb54c2615c53a21084af3f4b6db0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,3,219,169,152,220,181,76,38,21,197,58,33,8,74,243,244,182,219,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
