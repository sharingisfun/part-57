Fundamental Articles, Letters to Analytical Chemistry, and Technical Notes may address the general principles of chemical measurement science and need not directly address existing or potential analytical methodology. Manuscripts may be entirely theoretical with regard to analysis, or they may report experimental results that bear on theory. They may contribute to any phase of analytical measurements and concepts thereof, including but not limited to: sampling, bioanalysis, electrochemistry, mass spectrometry, microscale and nanoscale systems and structures, environmental analysis, separations, spectroscopy, chemical reactions and selectivity, instrumentation, imaging, surface analysis, and data processing. Manuscripts dealing with known analytical methods should offer a significant, original application of the method, a noteworthy improvement, or results on an important analyte.\r\n\r\nStated most broadly, the journal is concerned with measuring important chemical things (see March 1, 2007 Analytical Chemistry Editorial).\r\n\r\nIn addition, the journal publishes Features and news articles about major advances, trends, and challenges in analytical chemistry. These articles include peer-reviewed Features written by researchers and news stories that discuss novel analytical concepts and instruments. Both the Features and news stories draw upon scientific literature published in a wide range of related journals.\r\nPaper Length\r\n\r\nThe maximum lengths of research Articles and Letters are seven and three journal pages, respectively. Absent a convincing justification by the authors, the Editor will normally require condensation of longer papers. See author instructions for more information on how to estimate paper length.\r\nJournal Standing\r\n\r\nAnalytical Chemistry reported 88,324 total citations, a 7.3% increase, ranking it #1 in total citations out of 71 journals in the Analytical Chemistry category. The journal also has a high Impact Factor of 5.874, 12.7% increase, as reported by the 2010 Journal Citation ReportsÂ® (Thomson Reuters, 2011)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eeffd1aa384f17da453645fe041ab21a964514ee","amp;dn":"Analytical+Chemistry+%281929-2015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eeffd1aa384f17da453645fe041ab21a964514ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,255,209,170,56,79,23,218,69,54,69,254,4,26,178,26,150,69,20,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
