This program will allow you to make custom power tables for your AMD cpu so you can control basically everything about how your cpu ramps in speed and voltage allowing you to underclock, undervolt, overclock, overvolt, and more.. This is an internal AMD program so I hope you all enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfb1b7c80476409b89ddb6c20e3cb4b3140ce3d8","amp;dn":"PSCheck","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfb1b7c80476409b89ddb6c20e3cb4b3140ce3d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,177,183,200,4,118,64,155,137,221,182,194,14,60,180,179,20,12,227,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
