Groundbreaking tracks like the eyebrow-raising &quot;Head,&quot; the flawless &quot;Kiss,&quot; and &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot; (one of the great American rock singles) show that Prince was one of the most vital musicians of the 1980s. \r\nNot only was he prolific (he released one album every calendar year), but he's the only artist in the 1980s to release FOUR classic albums in one decade: &quot;Dirty Mind,&quot; &quot;1999,&quot; &quot;Purple Rain,&quot; and &quot;Sign O the Times.&quot; Madonna couldn't do it. Neither could Bruce Springsteen. Michael Jackson came close, but still no cigar. Even Prince's &quot;lesser&quot; singles like &quot;Sexy M.F.&quot; and &quot;Cream&quot; had more to offer than much of Top 40 radio. \r\nOf course, diehard fans are strongly recommended to get his 3 disc set that has a slew of his b-sides, but first-time listeners can't go wrong with picking this one up.
