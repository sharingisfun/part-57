An ISIS propaganda E book exposes how the jihadi group is targeting left wing activists.\n\nNuclear Terrorism Looms As Europe Implodes\n\nItâ€™s Good Friday. And in Europe that means a strict traditional observance of the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Unless of course you are a radical Muslim refugee, taught that the Crucifixion basically never happened. Or at the very least, itâ€™s meaning is completely different than the Christian understanding.\n\nMeanwhile Europe shell shocked by the attacks in Paris and Brussels, succumbs to the will of their radicalized foreign invaders. Where in the true meaning of the word Stockholm syndrome is exploding as the Gateway Pundit reports&quot;Swedish women are showing their support for Islam by taking selfies in hijabs after the Brussels bombings. Wrongly accusing Swedish men for attacks on Muslim women. While Swedish women are raped in record numbers by refugees and Muslim women are treated worse than any feminist could ever comprehend by a third world misogynistic society they are supposedly fleeing from.\n\nItâ€™s an inconceivable situation. A Clockwork Orange if you will. A radical Islamic horde has been given the golden ticket by NWO puppets to carve out an Islamic caliphate from London to Rome to Brussels.\n\nWhat will it take to mobilize real action, liberated from the NWOâ€™s control of the soft invasion? Will it take Nuclear Terrorism? As the UNâ€™s IAEA Chief Yukiya Amano warned &quot;Member states need to have sustained interest in strengthening nuclear security,&quot; Amano said. &quot;The countries which do not recognize the danger of nuclear terrorism is the biggest problem. Amano's comments came before a summit of around 50 leaders in Washington on March 31-April 1 on ensuring that nuclear material in the world's roughly 1,000 atomic facilities are secured.â€\n\nThe Brussels bombers may have been very close to infiltrating Belgiumâ€™s nuclear power plants. As Sputnik International reveals the Bakraoui brothers had been monitoring the home of the director of the Belgian nuclear research program for months. But the arrest of Paris shooter Salah Abdeslam hastened the terror network to downgrade their plans and launch the attack in Brussels, Belgium killing 31 and wounding dozens.\n\n20160325_Fri_NightlyNews.mp4 - 01:00:03 700 x 394\n\nScreens:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/CsCecdW.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/WZoUB4C.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/yFRdgUM.png","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89f80efc5e886617f94a1d6172d5b29db47f5e7c","amp;dn":"The+Infowars+Nightly+News+-+March+25%2C+2016+The+Battle+Line+Has+B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89f80efc5e886617f94a1d6172d5b29db47f5e7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,248,14,252,94,136,102,23,249,74,29,97,114,213,178,157,180,127,94,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
