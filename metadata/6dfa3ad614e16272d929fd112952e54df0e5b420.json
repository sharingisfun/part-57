In A Personal History of Moral Decay, he emerges as a simple writer struggling to find â€œright relationshipâ€ in a world where the political and the personal converge, without tidy resolution, through the coruscating prism of human experience. Threaded over decades and spanning continents, Smithâ€™s episodic memoir unspools in bright layers of crisp, laconic prose to illuminate the adventures, the moral failures, the fleeting epiphanies, and the interpersonal bonds that haunt and animate a life. Let this be your introduction to one of the most distinctive, if overlooked, voices in American literature.\r\n\r\nREVIEWS:\r\n\r\nReading Bradley Smith is about treasuring good writing, regardless of whether you deem the authorâ€™s opinions worthy of your moral rubber stamp; see also CÃ©line. But if you must have a moral, Smith earned every phrase the hard way.\r\n--Ann Sterzinger, Taki's Magazine\r\n\r\nLike Camusâ€™ Mersault, confronting a howling mob, or Beckettâ€™s Malone, dying alone, Bradley Smith is at last content with his life. This collection of his writing give the reader the opportunity to learn how a man at the center of so much controversy and outright hatred can find the air so much sweeter just exactly right there.\r\n--James O'Meara, Counter-Currents\r\n\r\nSmith writes with an understated simplicity, the argot of a man with little education but a lot of brains. His prose is raw and functional, conveying the anarchy of war, the raunchiness of his comrades, the sincerity of his lovers with honesty and conviction.\r\n--Matt Forney, author of Confessions of an Online Hustler\r\n\r\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\r\n\r\nBradley Reed Smith was born in South Central Los Angeles in 1930. He is a combat veteran of the Korean War (7th Cavalry) where he was twice wounded. He has served as a deputy sheriff in Los Angeles County. He has worked as a railway brakeman, as a merchant seaman, and in various construction trades. He was once a bullfighter in Mexico, and he was a freelance writer in Vietnam during the Tet Offensive. As a bookstore proprietor in Hollywood in the early 1960s, Smith was prosecuted â€“ and convicted â€“ for selling Henry Millerâ€™s Tropic of Cancer. He is the founding director of the Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust (CODOH). A Personal History of Moral Decay is his fourth book.\r\n\r\nDETAILS:\r\n\r\n312 pages\r\nPublisher: Nine-Banded Books; First edition (May 26, 2014)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 0989697282\r\nISBN-13: 978-0989697286","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dfa3ad614e16272d929fd112952e54df0e5b420","amp;dn":"A+Personal+History+of+Moral+Decay+%282014%29+by+Bradley+Smith","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dfa3ad614e16272d929fd112952e54df0e5b420","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,250,58,214,20,225,98,114,217,41,253,17,41,82,229,77,240,229,180,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
