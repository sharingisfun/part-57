There are many different ways that mind control is used actively today, all of which have to do with psychology. For starters, the world is under a mass blanket of brainwashing, and this is used by governments, corporations, and other organizations to keep a populace at bay. The many methods of mind control used range from television, to hypnosis, and to satanic rituals. However, science is actively becoming a growing facilitator of such â€œpractice.â€ In fact, scientists are seeking ways to expand the field of mind control. Which of course they claim it is for the benefit of humanity.\r\n\r\nWhile many will claim itâ€™s conspiracy, in reality, scientists are actively looking for ways to remotely control mice, by remote-controlled brain implant devices. Which are attached to the brains of mice through surgery, and then the implants administer drugs, as well as the scientists then control the mice through flashing lights. The lights effect the neurons in the brain. Through the implant the scientist can control the mouses movements, directions, and track every step taken from a neurological level. This is one prime example of what science can do with mind control. Another, which took place in 2012 would be when scientists hijacked a wormâ€™s brain. The scientists genetically engineered the microscopic worm to make its neurons sensitive to light. Upon which, they found out that they could control its movements through stimuli projected into its brain. Still think genetic modification and designer babies are a good idea?\r\n\r\nThese are just some of the examples that science is now playing a role in mind control. However, there is a lot more to be discussed on this particular topic; it is so vast that this is only the beginning. In this day and age, such science is not considered fringe, it is considered as beneficial to medicine. This type of science is deemed to be the future; when in reality it is the past. The very dark past, this is Nazi Germanyâ€™s reemergence into humanity, only this time; it is welcomed.\r\n\r\nIn this report we will be covering:\r\n\r\nThe newest scopes of mind control\r\nWhy are scientists now attempting to bridge the Bio-Electronic divide?\r\nWho will profit from these abominable acts?\r\nWho will fall victim to the new methods of mind control?\r\nWhat is the spiritual motive behind this?\r\nHow it will be done and some potential solutions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:149b7784eb0e6516cbde772e41319a8d0414261d","amp;dn":"Freedom+Fighter+Times+-+Welcome+to+the+Future%3A+Scientists+Take+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"149b7784eb0e6516cbde772e41319a8d0414261d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,155,119,132,235,14,101,22,203,222,119,46,65,49,154,141,4,20,38,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
