Sunshine and palm trees, mild Winter months and hot, hot Summers. A year round vacation destination for those in the know. But now the secret is out and the race is on to build and profit in paradise. Hotels are going up daily, visitors are flocking to travel agencies to enjoy the golden sunshine and sandy white beaches. But they need more - they want more. They want to be entertained. Rumor has it some of the world's finest entertainment providers have plans to build the grandest form of entertainment of them all... the theme park. It is not too late though - you can own a piece of paradise and profit mightily. What road will you take? Will you be a small time operator or try to build a resort complex so amazing guests will never leave your property? The choices are yours. Are you ready for the challenge of Park Wars?\r\n\r\nInstructions: This is just a basic patch. Install Park Wars as normal (http://www.wolverinestudios.com/downloads/PW/PWInstall.exe). Open the patch as admin. Click the &quot;Browse&quot; button and select the Park Wars.exe from the installation folder. Tick the &quot;Make Backup&quot; box if you want to make a backup of the original exe. Click the &quot;Crack&quot; button. That is it. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n    Now dig my grave\r\n    Beneath the bay willows' boughs\r\n    And with blackness cover it over again,\r\n    There for evermore\r\n    Go from my domain:\r\n    I wish to slumber in peace.\r\n                      - Aleksis Kivi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55dae5acf1b8a588a1fe55ce1defa17fdb214d30","amp;dn":"Park+Wars+Patch+-+SoN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55dae5acf1b8a588a1fe55ce1defa17fdb214d30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,218,229,172,241,184,165,136,161,254,85,206,29,239,161,127,219,33,77,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
