Teo doesnâ€™t really like people, theyâ€™re too messy, but he immediately realises that he and Clarice are meant to be together. And if Clarice doesnâ€™t accept that? Well, they just need to spend some time together, and sheâ€™ll come to realise that too.\r\nAnd yes, he has bought handcuffs and yes, he has taken her prisoner and yes, he is lying to her mother and to his mother and to the people at the hotel heâ€™s keeping her at, but itâ€™s all for her own good. \r\nSheâ€™ll understand. Sheâ€™ll fall in love. Sheâ€™ll settle down and be his loving wife. \r\nWonâ€™t she?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:844c50efdb9d4d891f3851211acf36e0365e44e2","amp;dn":"Perfect+Days+by+Raphael+Montes+%28ePub+Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"844c50efdb9d4d891f3851211acf36e0365e44e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,76,80,239,219,157,77,137,31,56,81,33,26,207,54,224,54,94,68,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
