Fundamental studies on these systems examine their unique structural, electronic, optical and chemical properties. A diverse array of experimental and theoretical methods have been focused on these systems to measure or predict their properties, and to compare these properties to more conventional states of matter. This series surveys recent developments ongoing at the forefront of this rapidly emerging field, focusing on spectroscopic measurements of molecular structure, kinetic and dynamic measurements of cluster chemistry, quantum theoretical models of cluster bonding, synthesis of new materials from clusters, and attempts to synthesize and isolate clusters in macroscopic quantities. Contributors include leading authorities in physical, inorganic, and organic chemistry, solid state physics and materials science","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:476a68690602323f08e97f1413d8d06a5cdbea67","amp;dn":"Advances+in+Metal+and+Semiconductor+Clusters+%5BVol.+3-5%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"476a68690602323f08e97f1413d8d06a5cdbea67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,106,104,105,6,2,50,63,8,233,127,20,19,216,208,106,92,219,234,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
