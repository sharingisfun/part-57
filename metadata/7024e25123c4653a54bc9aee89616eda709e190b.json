I was on board a young teen appearance and manifests super powers identical to Superman to be pursued by the police and scare the population. Batman can stop it using a fragment of a Kryptonite meteor that found near the ship. Superman appears to help you investigate and so the duo discovers that the girl's name is Kara Zor-El, Jor-El niece and cousin biological Superman. Within two weeks of Superman teaches Kara English language and reveals his identity as Clark Kent until Wonder Woman and Lyla (Precursor) arrive and convince the superhero that his cousin should remain in training in Themyscira Island to learn control his powers. On the planet of Apokolips, Darkseid want a replacement for Big Barda in the leadership of his personal guard, the Female Furies. When you feel the presence of Kara on Earth, he orders Granny Goodness and the Furies, who hijack the kriptoniana and bring to Apokolips.\r\n\r\nTitle in Brazil: Superman &amp; Batman - Revelation\r\nOriginal title: Superman / Batman: Apocalypse\r\nRelease: 2010\r\nGenre: Animation / Action\r\nDuration: 78 minutes\r\nDirected by Lauren Montgomery\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1673430/\r\n\r\nSize: 4.27 GB\r\nExtension Archive: .NRG\r\nVideo Quality: DVD-R\r\nVideo codec: MPEG-2\r\nAudio codec: AC3 5.1\r\nResolution: 720 x 480\r\nAudio: Portuguese / English / Spanish\r\nSubtitles: Portuguese / English / Spanish\r\n\r\ni.imgsafe.org/cc53b5a.jpg\r\n\r\ni.imgsafe.org/cb16387.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nSEED PLEASE\r\n\r\nENJOY","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7024e25123c4653a54bc9aee89616eda709e190b","amp;dn":"Superman+Batman+Apocalypse+2010+DVDR+R4+NTSC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7024e25123c4653a54bc9aee89616eda709e190b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,36,226,81,35,196,101,58,84,188,154,238,137,97,110,218,112,158,25,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
