Then, in a dramatic and electrifying change, described by scientists as â€œthe greatest riddle in human historyâ€, all the skills and qualities that we value most highly in ourselves appeared already fully formed, as though bestowed on us by hidden powers. In Supernatural Graham Hancock sets out to investigate this mysterious â€œbefore-and-after momentâ€ and to discover the truth about the influences that gave birth to the modern human mind. His quest takes him on a journey of adventure and detection from the stunningly beautiful painted caves of prehistoric France, Spain and Italy to remote rock shelters in the mountains of South Africa where he finds a treasure trove of extraordinary Stone Age art. He uncovers clues that lead him to travel to the depths of the Amazon rainforest to drink the powerful plant hallucinogen Ayahuasca with Indian shamans, whose paintings contain images of â€œsupernatural beingsâ€ identical to the animal-human hybrids depicted in prehistoric caves and rock shelters. And hallucinogens such as mescaline, also produce visionary encounters with exactly the same beings. Scientists at the cutting edge of consciousness research have begun to consider the possibility that such hallucinations may be real perceptions of other â€œdimensionsâ€. Could the â€œsupernaturalsâ€ first depicted in the painted caves and rock shelters be the ancient teachers of mankind? Could it be that human evolution is not just the â€œblindâ€, â€œmeaninglessâ€ process that Darwin identified, but something else, more purposive and intelligent, that we have barely even begun to understand? \r\n\r\npdf 19MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56131f440224eb2df7962b5c330235fd4e613400","amp;dn":"Graham+Hancock+-+SUPERNATURAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56131f440224eb2df7962b5c330235fd4e613400","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,19,31,68,2,36,235,45,247,150,43,92,51,2,53,253,78,97,52,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
