The event was all but destroyed by violence that marked the end of the peace and love euphoria of the 1960s. \r\n\r\nThe night began smoothly, with the supercharged Flying Burrito Brothers opening up for the Rolling Stones and performing the truck-driving classic &quot;Six Days on the Road&quot; and Tina Turner giving a sensually charged performance. But on this particular evening, the Stones made the fateful (and disastrous) decision to hire the Oakland chapter of the Hell's Angels motorcycle gang as bodyguards and bouncers. \r\n\r\nIt was a foolhardy, careless choice that turned the night into an unmitigated disaster; halfway through the Stones' act, the Angels killed one black spectator, and injured several others who were present (including Jefferson Airplane's lead singer Marty Balin). In the film, we watch Mick Jagger -- here an ebullient, charismatic performer of bisexual charm -- reduced to standing on stage like a frightened child with his finger in his mouth in wake of the violence. \r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, the Grateful Dead refused to perform after the violence erupted; the picture ends on a despairing note, with the Stones repeatedly watching a film of the murder. \r\n\r\nCelebrated documentarians Albert and David Maysles directed and Haskell Wexler shot the film, with heightened instinct and control; as a result, this film is considered one of the greatest rock documentaries ever made. Stones songs performed include &quot;Brown Sugar,&quot; &quot;Under My Thumb,&quot; and &quot;Sympathy for the Devil.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Mick Taylor, Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman \r\nDIRECTOR......: Albert Maysles, David Maysles\r\nGENRE.........: Documentary | Concert \r\nRATING........: 7.9/10  7,884 votes\r\nMETASCORE.....: 80\r\nIMDB link.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065780\r\nRUNTIME.......: 1h 32mn\r\nSIZE..........: 4.74GB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: x264 (  )\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1436x1080\r\nASPECT RATIO..: 1.33:1\r\nBITRATE.......: 5500 Kbps\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO1........: English DTS 5.1 1500 Kbps\r\nAUDIO2........: English DTS 2.0 318 Kbps\r\nAUDIO3........: Commentary with Albert Maysles, Charlotte Zwerin, and Stanley Goldstein\r\nSOURCE........: Untouched Criterion Blu Ray\r\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG, FRE\r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2016-03-17\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n \nhttp://postimg.org/gallery/1hxxfflpw/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSample Clip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b9e6a259a9f18ad4f816b7826973b77dfd18350","amp;dn":"Gimme.Shelter.1970.Criterion.1080p.BluRay.x264.DTS-SARTRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b9e6a259a9f18ad4f816b7826973b77dfd18350","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,158,106,37,154,159,24,173,79,129,107,120,38,151,59,119,223,209,131,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
