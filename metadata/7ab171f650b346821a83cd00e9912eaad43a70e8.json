If you are a member of a scene release team or group and/or a reverse coder, please try to make it useful for everyone. :-)\r\n\r\nI think it is a very useful IT management software.\r\n\r\nThanks for downloading and helping the community. :-)\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Empirum Preinstallation Environment\r\n\r\nWith Empirum, all networked devices and corporate software assets can be administrated efficiently and made available from a central management console. The modular structure of the software suite is completely database-based and allows for the intuitive handling of all functionalities; this way, it is possible to easily distribute, install or modify all components of a system â€“ operating system, applications and personal settings and files â€“ with Empirum. The secure deletion of all data at the end of the usage time is also a part of the functionality spectrum.\r\n\r\nThis life-cycle approach is combined with a mature, role-based configuration management. Via drag &amp; drop, you may group corporate users and systems arbitrarily and then assign the appropriate software. These defined configuration standards can be inherited within an administration group and also allow for the creation of consistent, easy-to-maintain structures, even in decentralized IT environments. The completely integrated patch management protects devices and servers against attacks on known security gaps without increasing the administration effort. Comprehensive scaling and monitoring functionalities help to variably control and monitor installation and roll-out processes.\r\n\r\nEmpirum can be integrated with existing IT infrastructures and other IT management solutions â€“ either completely or as a modular add-on. With its centralized inventory of all systems, combined with a consolidated reporting and alarm management, Empirum creates the basis to provide a maximum of transparency of the corporate IT infrastructure. An inventory history and alarm mechanisms inform the administrator in real time on events such as changes to the memory of a PC, failed installations or the latest Microsoft patches.\r\n\r\nEmpirum - manage. save. relax.\r\n\r\n\r\nHave nice day, hoping and looking for any working solution. :-)\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ab171f650b346821a83cd00e9912eaad43a70e8","amp;dn":"Matrix42+Empirum+Preinstallation+Environment+v14","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ab171f650b346821a83cd00e9912eaad43a70e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,177,113,246,80,179,70,130,26,131,205,0,233,145,46,170,212,58,112,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
