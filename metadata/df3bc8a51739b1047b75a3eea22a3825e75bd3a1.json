Six series have been made (called seasons in the US), the sixth airing in the autumn of 2015 in the UK and Ireland. The fifth began airing in the United States on 4 January 2015.[2][3][4] On 26 March 2015, the sixth series was confirmed to be the final series,[5] with the final episode airing in the UK on 25 December 2015 on ITV.\r\n\r\nThe series, set in the fictional Yorkshire country estate of Downton Abbey, depicts the lives of the aristocratic Crawley family and their domestic servants in the post-Edwardian eraâ€”with the great events in history having an effect on their lives and on the British social hierarchy. Such events depicted throughout the series include news of the sinking of the RMS Titanic in the first series; the outbreak of the First World War, the Spanish influenza pandemic, and the Marconi scandal in the second series; the interwar period and the formation of the Irish Free State in the third series; the Teapot Dome scandal in the fourth series; and the United Kingdom general election of 1923, the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, and the Beer Hall Putsch in the fifth series.\r\n\r\nDownton Abbey has received critical acclaim from television critics and won numerous accolades, including a Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film and a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Miniseries or Movie. It was recognised by Guinness World Records as the most critically acclaimed English-language television series of 2011. It earned the most nominations of any international television series in the history of the Primetime Emmy Awards, with twenty-seven in total (after two series).[6] It was the most watched television series on both ITV and PBS, and subsequently became the most successful British costume drama series since the 1981 television serial of Brideshead Revisited.[7] By the third series, it had become one of the most widely watched television drama shows in the world.[8]\r\n\r\nOn 26 March 2015, Carnival Films and ITV announced that the sixth series would be the last. The sixth series aired on ITV between 20 September 2015 and 8 November 2015, and a final episode, serving as the annual Christmas special, aired on 25 December 2015. Although there are no plans in place, there are strong rumours of a future film adaptation, with executive producer Gareth Neame saying that he was &quot;very interested&quot; and Alex Donohue of bookmakers Ladbrokes stating that &quot;it only looks like being a matter of time before the film is released.&quot;[9]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df3bc8a51739b1047b75a3eea22a3825e75bd3a1","amp;dn":"Downton+Abbey+S03+Season+3+ILLegaLeagLe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df3bc8a51739b1047b75a3eea22a3825e75bd3a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,59,200,165,23,57,177,4,123,117,163,238,162,42,56,37,231,91,211,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
