Rather than overwhelm with huge sonic\r\nwashes of guitar and booming drums, Tool employs a propulsive, snaky approach that\r\nmakes use of undulating rhythms and clipped, percussive guitar riffs. Maynard James\r\nKeenan's vocals follow suit, opting for a heavily processed slow burn instead of the post-grunge bellow favored by so many hard-rock bands. Instead of flailing\r\nuncontrollably in all directions, the group's raw, energetic sound is tightly directed for maximum impact.\r\n\r\nOn songs like &quot;Stinkfist,&quot; Keenan rails against injustice while the band churns\r\nmercilessly behind him. There is very little humor or light in Tool's worldview\r\n(except for song titles like &quot;Hooker With A Penis&quot;); these are songs of painstakingly articulated angst, and they are delivered in an earnest, deadpan manner. These fierce rockers are dead set on making their point, and make it they do, with all the bloodshed and carnage that entails.\r\n\r\nTool: Maynard James Keenan (vocals); Adam Jones (guitar); Justin Chancellor (bass);\r\nDanny Carey (drums).\r\n\r\nPersonnel: Maynard James Keenan, Bill Hicks (vocals); Eban Schletter (organ); David\r\nBottrill (keyboards); Chris Pitman (synthesizer).\r\n\r\nAdditional personnel includes: Marko Fox (vocals); Eban Schletter (organ); Chris\r\nPittman (synthesizer); D.B.
