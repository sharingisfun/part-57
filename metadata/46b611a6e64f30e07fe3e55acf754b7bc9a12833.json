Thankfully, this didn't last long!\r\nEnjoy the sounds of what was, for a brief moment - the real &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot;!\r\n\r\nshntool text detailing CD rip and subsequent fix included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46b611a6e64f30e07fe3e55acf754b7bc9a12833","amp;dn":"Fleetwood+Mac+-+1974-10-08+-+Ultrasonic+Studios%2C+Hempstead%2C+NY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46b611a6e64f30e07fe3e55acf754b7bc9a12833","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,182,17,166,230,79,48,224,127,227,229,90,207,117,75,123,201,161,40,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
