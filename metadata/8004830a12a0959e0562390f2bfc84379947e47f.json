In this latest addition to the series, the inimitable Lucas Davenport faces a daunting adversary unlike any he has met before. Clara Rinker is the best hitwoman in the business. An attractive, well-spoken southern woman, she does her job, collects her money, and disappears. But when a prominent defense attorney hires her for a hit in Minnesota, her life gets complicated. A witness survives, and she's on Lucas Davenport's turf. Now she must use her superior cunning and intelligence to eliminate loose ends, and Lucas is the most worrisome loose end of all. Gifted narrator Richard Ferrone has enhanced all ten of Sanford's gripping novels with his own brand of unrelenting energy. Under his spell, the brilliant characters and nonstop action contrive to keep you up into the late hours of the night","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8004830a12a0959e0562390f2bfc84379947e47f","amp;dn":"John+Sandford-Certain+Prey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8004830a12a0959e0562390f2bfc84379947e47f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,4,131,10,18,160,149,158,5,98,57,15,43,252,132,55,153,71,228,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
