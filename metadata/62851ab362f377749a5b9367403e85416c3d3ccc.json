Lock Up was joined by Peter TÃ¤gtgren (Hypocrisy) for its debut album, 1999's Pleasures Pave Sewers, and Tomas Lindberg (At The Gates, Disfear) for 2002's Hate Breeds Suffering and a Japanese tour.\r\n\r\nThe band was later joined by guitarist Anton Reisenegger (Chile's Pentagram and Criminal) in place of the late Pintado.\r\n\r\nLock Up have played very few live shows. In 2009, the band announced that they would play the Damnation Festival that year. The line-up featured Embury, Barker, Lindberg and Reisenegger. It was touted as the band's last ever live show; however, they later booked more shows for 2010 and 2012. During February of that year they scheduled a ten show mini-tour in the United States. It was their first time playing in that country. Unfortunately Shane Embury was unable to make the shows so Danny Lilker from Nuclear Assault filled in on bass for the duration of the trek.\r\n\r\nOn December 3, 2010 Lock Up uploaded the first new piece of music in eight years, a track titled &quot;Life of Devastation&quot;, to the band's official MySpace page. The song is set to appear on a split seven-inch single with Misery Index in 2011.\r\n\r\nThe band's third studio album, Necropolis Transparent, was recorded in November and December 2010 at HVR Studios in Ipswich, England, and features guest appearances by Peter TÃ¤gtgren and Jeff Walker (Carcass, Brujeria). It will be released on July 1 in Europe and July 12 in North America by Nuclear Blast Records.\r\n\r\n\r\nYear: 1999 - 2013\r\nCountry: United Kingdom\r\nGenre: Grindcore/Death Metal\r\nCodec: Mp3\r\nBitrate: Various\r\nSize: 365 MB\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscography:\r\n1999 - Pleasures Pave Sewers\r\n2002 - Hate Breeds Suffering\r\n2005 - Play Fast or Die, Live in Japan\r\n2007 - Violent Reprisal (Compilation)\r\n2011 - Necropolis Transparent\r\n2011 - Thus the Beast Decapitated Siberian (Split)\r\n2013 - Infinite in its Nothingness (Single)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62851ab362f377749a5b9367403e85416c3d3ccc","amp;dn":"Lockup+-+Discography+%5BMetal%5D+%281999+-+2013%29+%28mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62851ab362f377749a5b9367403e85416c3d3ccc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,133,26,179,98,243,119,116,154,91,147,103,64,62,133,65,108,61,60,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
