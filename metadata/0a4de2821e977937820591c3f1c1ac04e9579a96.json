It provides a simple and easily accessible publication mechanism for the growing number of inorganic, metal-organic and organic crystal structure determinations. The electronic submission, validation, refereeing and publication facilities of the journal ensure very rapid and high-quality publication, whilst key indicators and validation reports provide measures of structural reliability. The average publication time is less than one month.\r\nArticles are published in a short-format style with enhanced supplementary materials. Each publication consists of a complete package - the published article, HTML and PDF supplements, CIF, structure factors, graphics, and any other submitted supplementary files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a4de2821e977937820591c3f1c1ac04e9579a96","amp;dn":"Acta+Crystallographica+Section+E%3A+Structure+Reports+Online","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a4de2821e977937820591c3f1c1ac04e9579a96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,77,226,130,30,151,121,55,130,5,145,195,241,193,172,4,233,87,154,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
