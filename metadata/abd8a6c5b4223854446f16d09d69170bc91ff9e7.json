Starting as a weekly in the mid-1920s, the magazine is now published 47 times per year, with five of these issues covering two-week spans. Although its reviews and events listings often focus on cultural life of New York City, The New Yorker has a wide audience outside of New York and USA. It is well known in its commentaries on popular culture and eccentric Americana; its attention to modern fiction by the inclusion of short stories and literary reviews; its rigorous fact checking and copyediting; its journalism on world politics and social issues; and its famous, single-panel cartoons sprinkled throughout each issue","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abd8a6c5b4223854446f16d09d69170bc91ff9e7","amp;dn":"The+New+Yorker+-+March+14%2C+2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abd8a6c5b4223854446f16d09d69170bc91ff9e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,216,166,197,180,34,56,84,68,111,22,208,157,105,23,11,201,31,249,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
