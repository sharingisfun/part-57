Inspired by Indian spiritual master Meher Baba, Pete Townshend created the character of Tommy, the 'deaf, dumb and blind boy'. Broke and fragmenting when they started recording, the album went on to sell over 20 million copies. In this film, the Who speak for the first time about the making of the iconic album and how its success changed their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nGSpot Says:\r\nDVD VOB format\r\nMPEG-2Program Stream &lt;&lt; (1 vid, 1 aud)\r\nSys Bitrate 10080 kb/s VBR 8471 kbps I/L TFF\r\nPAL 16:9\r\nAC3 0xbd[0x80]:48000Hz 384 kb/s tot,\r\nStereo (2/0)\r\n\r\n\r\nPlay It LOUD!\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6eda39651ed2ebd741c7a2dc50b64858e43d15a","amp;dn":"The+Who-The+Making+of+Tommy-BBCFour-Oct-2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6eda39651ed2ebd741c7a2dc50b64858e43d15a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,237,163,150,81,237,46,189,116,28,122,45,197,11,100,133,142,67,209,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
