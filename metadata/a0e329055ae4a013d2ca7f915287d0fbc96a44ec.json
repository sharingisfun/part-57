The maritime disaster that occurred in real life inspire Melville to write Moby-Dick. However, the book told only half the story. Heart of the Sea reveals the dire consequences of the meeting, as the surviving crew of the boat is taken to its limits and forced to do the unthinkable to stay alive. Facing storms, hunger, panic and despair, the men will be led to question their deepest beliefs, the value of their lives to the morality of their activity, while its captain seeks guidance on the open sea and his first sergeant major still tries to defeat the great whale.\r\n\r\nTitle in Brazil: In the Heart of the Sea\r\nOriginal title: In the Heart of the Sea\r\nRelease Date: 2015 (IMDb)\r\nGenre: Action / Adventure / Biography\r\nDuration: 202 minutes\r\nDirector: Ron Howard\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1390411/\r\n\r\nSize: 25.11 GB\r\nExtension Archive: .MKV\r\nVideo Quality: Bluray (Remux)\r\nVideo codec: h264\r\nAudio codec: AC3 5.1 / TrueHD 7.1\r\nResolution: 1920 x 1080\r\nAudio: Portuguese / English\r\nSubtitles: Portuguese\r\n\r\nultraimg.com/images/C6dc4b.jpg\r\n\r\nultraimg.com/images/frame3ae5db.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nSEED PLEASE\r\n\r\nENJOY","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0e329055ae4a013d2ca7f915287d0fbc96a44ec","amp;dn":"In+the+Heart+of+the+1080p+BluRay+Remux+AVC+TrueHD+Atmos+7.1+DUAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0e329055ae4a013d2ca7f915287d0fbc96a44ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,227,41,5,90,228,160,19,210,202,127,145,82,135,208,251,201,106,68,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
