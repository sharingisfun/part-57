The appearance of Jimmy Page was his first notable public \r\nappearance in a long time.  The &quot;Prelude&quot; instrumental was the \r\nChopin prelude he used for &quot;Death Wish 2&quot;.  Page also began playing \r\na song he and Paul Rodgers were working on called &quot;Bird On A Wing&quot; \r\n(A descendent of the unfinished Zeppelin song &quot;Swan Song&quot;) \r\nwhich went on to become &quot;Midnight Moonlight&quot; during The Firm years.\r\n\r\nENJOY &amp; SHARE!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16478c5a41ad942c2be5437355c09d8fda9a818d","amp;dn":"Various+Artists+-+A.R.M.S.+Concert+12-2-83","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16478c5a41ad942c2be5437355c09d8fda9a818d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,71,140,90,65,173,148,44,43,229,67,115,85,192,157,143,218,154,129,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
