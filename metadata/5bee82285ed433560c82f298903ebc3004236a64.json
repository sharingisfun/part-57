It currently exists as an international franchise and an online music store.[1] From 1960 until 2006, Tower operated retail stores in the United States, which closed when Tower Records filed for bankruptcy and liquidation. Tower.com was purchased by a separate entity and was not affected by the retail store closings. The corporate name was MTS Inc., but this was little-known compared to the much more widely recognized Tower Records.&quot; (Wikipedia)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bee82285ed433560c82f298903ebc3004236a64","amp;dn":"All+Things+Must+Pass+-+the+rise+and+fall+of+Tower+Records.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bee82285ed433560c82f298903ebc3004236a64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,238,130,40,94,212,51,86,12,130,242,152,144,62,188,48,4,35,106,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
