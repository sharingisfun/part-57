He wrote several video\r\ngames, but another ENCOM engineer, Ed Dillinger [David Warner], stole them and passed\r\nthem off as his own, earning himself a series of promotions until reaching Senior\r\nExecutive VP. Having left the company, Flynn attempts to obtain evidence of Dillingers\r\nactions by hacking the ENCOM mainframe, but is repeatedly stopped by the Master Control\r\nProgram [MCP], an artificial intelligence written by Dillinger. However, since its\r\ninception the MCP has become power-hungry, illegally appropriating business and even\r\ngovernment programs and absorbing them to increase its own capacities; it informs Dillinger\r\nof its plans to subjugate the Pentagon and the Kremlin, and expresses interest in China\r\nwith its request for Chinese-translation programs, blackmailing Dillinger into compliance\r\nwith records of his theft of the games.\r\n\r\nBox Office\r\n\r\nBudget: $17,000,000 (estimated)\r\nOpening Weekend: $4,761,795 (USA) (11 July 1982)\r\nGross: $33,000,000 (USA)\r\nWorldwide: N/A\r\nFilming Dates: April 1981 - July 1981\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that all screenshot was captured at 1080p, resized to 720p\r\nand then compressed using PNG to improve the loading time.\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/qcnkXf3.jpg  \r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/Qivvhnp.jpg\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/iXvPOl2.png\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/cXwU8He.png\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/0NCj843.png  \r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/1GEUxWT.jpg\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084827/\r\n\r\n:: General ::\r\n\r\nFormat: Matroska/MKV\r\nFile Size: 9.34 GiB\r\nOverall Bit Rate: 14.0 Mbps\r\nFormat profile:   \r\nDuration: 01:35:47\r\nSample: Yes\r\nSubtitles: English\r\nChapters: Yes\r\nEncoded By oneanight\r\n\r\n:: Video Info ::\r\n\r\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\r\nWriting library: x264\r\nVideo bitrate: 12.0 Mbps\r\nResolution: 1920 X 880 pixels\r\nAspect ratio(AR): 2.2:1\r\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\r\n\r\n:: Audio Info ::\r\n\r\nFormat profile: DTS / AC3\r\nAudio Bit rate 1: 1509 Kbps\r\nAudio Bit rate 2: 448 Kbps Kbps\r\nCompression mode: Lossy/Lossy\r\nBit rate mode Constant/Constant\r\nAudio Language: English\r\nSampling rate: 48.0 KHz Bit depth 24 bits/48.0 KHz\r\nChannel positions: Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\r\nChannels:1 &amp; 2 6 channels 5.1 Surround\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6dd8394d6364c2ee7fa8640f19fdc3ee17f9c02","amp;dn":"Tron+-+%5B1982%5D+1080p+BDRip+x264+DTS+AC3+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6dd8394d6364c2ee7fa8640f19fdc3ee17f9c02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,221,131,148,214,54,76,46,231,250,134,64,241,159,220,62,225,127,156,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
