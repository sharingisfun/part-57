On January 21, 1983, a man wearing a defective parachute plummets onto a residential street in Corbin, Kentucky, dying instantly. His body is surrounded by bags full of cocaine and his name is Drew Thompson. Raylan discovers a mystery when a vintage diplomatic bag is found hidden at Arlo's house containing only a driver's license in the name of Waldo Truth. Further investigation reveals that the parachutist was actually Waldo Truth, and that Drew Thompson may still be alive, but Arlo refuses to divulge any information. As the investigation continues to unfold, information is revealed that could lead to the arrest of a major mafia figure. Raylan is now living above a bar and attempting to stash extra money away to provide for his unborn child and is in a questionable relationship with the bartender, Lindsey Salazar. Meanwhile, Boyd Crowder seeks to expand his empire with help from an old army buddy Colton &quot;Colt&quot; Rhodes (Ron Eldard). However, his efforts are complicated by the arrival of a snake-handling revival preacher named Billy St. Cyr (Joe Mazzello). Billy's success is cutting into Boyd's profits, as his users and dealers are getting hooked on faith instead of drugs. At the same time, his cousin Johnny (David Meunier) grows ever more resentful of Boyd's success and plans to betray him to Wynn Duffy. Meanwhile, Boyd's ambition has him force a deal with Duffy that involves Boyd in chasing down leads in the same parachutist mystery, eventually bringing Boyd to an unexpected crossroads that threatens his personal or professional destruction.\r\n\r\nMain article: Justified (season 4)\r\nNo. in\r\nseries  \tNo. in\r\nseason  \tTitle \t \r\n\r\n40 \t          1 \t&quot;Hole in the Wall&quot; \t \r\n41 \t          2 \t&quot;Where's Waldo?&quot; \t \r\n42 \t          3 \t&quot;Truth and Consequences&quot; \t \r\n43 \t          4 \t&quot;This Bird Has Flown&quot; \t \r\n44 \t          5 \t&quot;Kin&quot; \t \r\n45 \t          6 \t&quot;Foot Chase&quot; \t \r\n46 \t          7 \t&quot;Money Trap&quot; \t \r\n47 \t          8 \t&quot;Outlaw&quot; \t \r\n48 \t          9 \t&quot;The Hatchet Tour&quot; \t \r\n49 \t         10 \t&quot;Get Drew&quot; \t \r\n50 \t         11 \t&quot;Decoy&quot; \t \r\n51 \t         12 \t&quot;Peace of Mind&quot; \t \r\n52 \t         13 \t&quot;Ghosts&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:740133b62609167fa9d56909879851122cc5d6c9","amp;dn":"Justified+-+Season+4+of+6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"740133b62609167fa9d56909879851122cc5d6c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,1,51,182,38,9,22,127,169,213,105,9,135,152,81,18,44,197,214,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
