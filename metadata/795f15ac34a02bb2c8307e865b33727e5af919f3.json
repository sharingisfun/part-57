Dispatching his foes with well-paced bullets and well-turned phrases, Sebastian tracks down his nemesis through his old associates in the Club de Paradis Artificiel, whose surviving members have managed to evade the harsh punishment he received. But the closer Sebastian gets to his quarry, the more prophetic the club name seemsâ€“and the more muddled reality itself becomes.
