He was a successful soloist in his time, famous as a session player and as a spectacular on-stage performer. On this CD you can hear almost all his recordings he has ever made, few in number but of extreme perfectionality in his legendary bouzoukee playing. \r\nMost of these recordings were made during his stay in the U.S.A. in the early 60's. At that time, 8th Avenue Greek clubs in New York, also known as &quot;Bouzoukee Casbahs&quot;, were a meeting point for greeks as well for the rest of the americans interested in &quot;oriental&quot; sounds.\r\nNight clubs such as &quot;Ali Baba&quot;, &quot;Grecian Palace&quot;, &quot;Sophie's Newlife&quot; etc., offered a variety of oriental and greek dishes, spectacular bouzoukee music and enchanting belly'dancer s.\r\nEnjoy &quot;Bebis&quot; Stergiou&quot; in these rare recordings he made in the company of great artists such as Stelios Souyoultzis, a singer of equal talent, and the seducing Sevas Hanoum whose insinuating cadenzas promise all things to all men.\r\n\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/xY5SXzt.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n01.
