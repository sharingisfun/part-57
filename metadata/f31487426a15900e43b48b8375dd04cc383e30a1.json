No plot created by anyone in IMDB.  So be the first on your block or even in your state to have this old jewel.\r\n\r\nOf all Republic's serials, I consider this one to be one of the most underrated. The outdoor scenery, the choreographic fist-fights, sharp cinematography, the presence of the beautiful Helen Talbot, and some of the more thrilling chapter-endings in a while help make this opus a highly recommended entry. It was originally meant to be a Mountie serial but for some reason it became a Ranger cliffhanger. The plot concerns the search for a specific Indian rug upon which is the map to hidden treasure. The storyline runs smoothly and inventively, much more effectively than others in a similar genre. Republic were and are always the Lords of the Serials, and this Larry Thompson cliffhanger, directed nobly by the prolific Spencer G. Bennet and Fred Brannon, is a very pleasing effort","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f31487426a15900e43b48b8375dd04cc383e30a1","amp;dn":"King+of+the+Forest+Rangers+%281946%29+Old+Time+Serial+%28OTS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f31487426a15900e43b48b8375dd04cc383e30a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,20,135,66,106,21,144,14,67,180,139,131,117,221,4,204,56,62,48,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
