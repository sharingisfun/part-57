Her no-account ex has taught her she canâ€™t rely on anyone but herself, even if that means working two jobs and barely scraping by. \r\n\r\nBig, burly, handsome doctor Eddie Rochon makes Gemma wonder if good men are more than a myth. She's tempted to give him a chance ... but trust is hard after all she's been through. \r\n\r\nHeâ€™s ready to save the day ... \r\n\r\nEddieâ€™s a polar bear shifter with a gift for taking care of people â€¦ and a bit of a gnome problem. When he realizes the curvy brunette with the adorable little boy is his mate, his need to help her kicks into overdrive--but if he tries too hard, heâ€™ll drive her away. \r\n\r\nWelcome home ... or see you later? \r\n\r\nWhen Gemmaâ€™s ex turns up, things get even more complicated. Can Eddie protect his newfound family and convince his mate that he's not like other men she's known?
