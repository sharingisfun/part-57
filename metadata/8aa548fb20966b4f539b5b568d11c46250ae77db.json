Some of you silly humans describe it as Twin-stick, Deck-building, and Rogue-lite - whatever that means. \r\n\r\n\r\nFail but prevail!\r\nMy show is known for its tense moments and spectacular deaths. Quick reactions are important - but so is a good strategy. Contestants who learn from their deaths, tend not to repeat them. \r\n\r\n\r\nUse powerful artifacts!\r\nWhen you grow in popularity, you will gain artifacts that you can strategically combine in many ways! The Legendary Helmet and Brofist Power Glove combo definitely caught my attention! \r\n\r\n\r\nThe show must go on!\r\nAs architect and show host, my priority is to keep the show interesting and fresh. I will frequently update the content and find new and interesting ways to entertain you. To interact with you humans, I use â€œTwitterâ€ - and feedback is always welcome. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the things you can do in my show\r\nFry a rat with a beam of pure light!\r\nCombine powers into strategic decks of gore galore!\r\nCompete with other contestants in daily challenges and seasons.\r\nBe entertained by a myriad of enemies, cards, arenas, traps, boons, titans, special rules, campaigns, companions, emblems, environments, and more!\r\nComplete my mysterious quests!\r\nHave fun â€¦ and die!\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nPlease like my uploads and give thanks and love when due. I'm new and want to be able to give back and be a part of a community that has done so much for me and i have lots to offer in return, thanks.\r\n\r\n- TheDarkKnight","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8aa548fb20966b4f539b5b568d11c46250ae77db","amp;dn":"Forced+Showdown+%28Early+Build%29+-+TheDarkKnight","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8aa548fb20966b4f539b5b568d11c46250ae77db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,165,72,251,32,150,107,79,83,155,91,86,141,17,196,98,80,174,119,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
