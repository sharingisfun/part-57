Since most\r\nof such invasion is by means of electronic data gathering and\r\ncross-referencing, you must be able to short-circuit these\r\nprocedures effectively.\r\nThe most efficient method today is through the use of\r\nwhat we call &quot;alternate identification&quot;. If the new names\r\nand numbers you plug into the networks don't match\r\nthe old ones, you have not only &quot;disappeared&quot;, but have also\r\nbeen &quot;reborn&quot;. And being reborn means leaving your past records\r\nwhere they can no longer affect you and your lifestyle.\r\nThis &quot;disappearing&quot; of individuals is obviously discomforting\r\nto institutions and governments determined to control\r\npersonal activities in the Land of the Free. To them\r\nit appears downright seditious, since in reality their power\r\ndepends directly on the number of people they can control --\r\nthrough computerized records, of course.\r\nTo those who actually &quot;disappear&quot;, however, the act is\r\none of tremendous personal liberation. Free men owe very\r\nlittle to those who restrict opportunities on the basis of past\r\nrecords. An extreme example, which nevertheless applies\r\nto all of us, is this: When a person convicted of a felony\r\nhas served his full sentence, is he then &quot;free&quot;? Hardly.\r\nWhat he will experience is really a LIFE SENTENCE of second-rate\r\nopportunity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c581117d73a049a11f91be86e0d4a3acb1de804d","amp;dn":"Eden+Press+-+100+Ways+to+Disappear+and+Live+Free.7z","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c581117d73a049a11f91be86e0d4a3acb1de804d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,129,17,125,115,160,73,161,31,145,190,134,224,212,163,172,177,222,128,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
